Alright, I need to add postconditions for each action in the story. Postconditions are changes resulting from the action, either in emotional links or tensions. At least one must exist per action, and they shouldn't repeat preconditions if any existed.

Starting with "travel_to_find": The prince's search leads him to find the princess, likely increasing his romantic feelings towards her. So, I'll add a positive love link from him to her. No tension changes here since he's just searching.

Next, "storm_arrives" brings the princess into a life-threatening situation, so her health is now at risk due to exposure. This adds a health_at_risk tension.

When the princess "seek_shelter", she finds safety with the queen and prince, which likely makes her feel grateful. So I'll add a positive friendship link towards them. Also, resolving some of the previous life_at_risk tension.

The queen's "test_with_pea" causes the princess discomfort, so her health is at risk again. This adds another health_at_risk tension but also proves she's genuine, which strengthens the prince's love for her.

In "sleep_badly", the princess's health issue remains, but since it confirms she's real, the prince's romantic feelings increase further towards her.

Finally, "marry" resolves all previous tensions as they unite in marriage. Both life and health tensions are resolved to normal, and their love is solidified with a strong positive link.
