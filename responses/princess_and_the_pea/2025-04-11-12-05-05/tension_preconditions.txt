Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to add tension preconditions to each action in the story. The user wants me to identify when a tension is a prerequisite for an action and specify its type, source, and target.

Starting with "travel_to_find": There's no direct tension here; it's more about the prince's desire. So no tensions needed.

Next, "storm_arrives" creates a life_at_risk situation because of the harsh weather affecting the princess. The storm is an external factor, so 'from' would be '-', and 'to' is the princess.

When the princess "seek_shelter", her action is motivated by the ongoing storm, which is still putting her life at risk. So similar to the previous step.

The queen's "test_with_pea" doesn't directly involve tension; it's more about testing. So no tensions here.

In "sleep_badly", the pea causes health issues for the princess, so health_at_risk applies here, from the action of sleeping (subject) to her own health.

Finally, "marry" happens after all tensions are resolved, so no specific tension is needed here.

I'll map these out accordingly.
