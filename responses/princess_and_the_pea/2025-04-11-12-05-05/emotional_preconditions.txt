Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story. I need to identify when an emotional link is a prerequisite for an action and specify its type (friendship or love) and magnitude (-3 to 3).

Starting with the first action: "travel_to_find". The prince's motivation here is his desire for romantic love, so he must have a strong positive emotional link towards the concept of finding a princess. Since there's no specific object here, it's more about his internal drive.

Next, "storm_arrives" creates tension but doesn't directly involve an emotional link between characters, so no preconditions here.

When the princess "seek_shelter", she might have a neutral or slightly positive feeling towards the prince or queen for helping her. It’s not a strong emotion, just enough to seek help.

The queen's action of "test_with_pea" is driven by skepticism about the princess. This implies a negative emotional link from the queen towards the princess, maybe around -1 or -2.

In "sleep_badly", the princess feels discomfort due to the test, but it’s more about her physical state than an emotional link. No precondition needed here.

Finally, "marry" requires a strong positive emotional link of love between the prince and princess. The magnitude should be high, like 3, as it's a significant commitment.

I'll map these out for each action.
