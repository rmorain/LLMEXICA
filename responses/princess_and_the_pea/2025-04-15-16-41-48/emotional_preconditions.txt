Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a story about a prince searching for a real princess and the test the queen uses involving a pea under mattresses. They want me to analyze the story by identifying actions related to emotional links (non-romantic or romantic) and tensions (like character dead, life at risk, etc.). Then, for each action, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to emotional links.

First, I need to understand what each part entails. Emotional links are about how characters feel about each other, either platonically or romantically. Tensions involve conflicts or risks that create suspense in the story.

Looking at the story, it's about a prince wanting a real princess. He's been searching and is sad because he can't find one. That sets up some emotional context—his desire for a real princess is a romantic link. Then a storm happens, and a princess arrives. The queen tests her by placing a pea under multiple mattresses to see if she's sensitive enough.

I should break down the story into key events:

1. Prince wants a real princess, is sad.
2. Storm happens, princess comes.
3. Queen tests with pea under mattresses.
4. Princess feels the pea and proves herself.
5. Prince marries her, pea goes to museum.

Now, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links or tensions. The prince's desire (romantic link) is an action—maybe 'desires' as a romantic link. His sadness might also be an emotional state but perhaps not an action per se.

When the princess arrives during the storm, that's an action where she seeks shelter. Then the queen tests her sensitivity with the pea, which could relate to non-romantic trust or verification. The princess feeling the pea shows her royal sensitivity, which confirms her status and leads to the marriage—a romantic emotional link.

As for tensions, I don't see any immediate life risks or imprisonment in this story. The storm is a setting but not a tension type listed. So maybe no tensions apply here beyond the test itself, which might be a mild tension of uncertainty but doesn't fit the specified types (character dead, life at risk, etc.).

I'll structure each action with subject and object if applicable. For example, prince desires princess as a romantic link. Queen tests princess's sensitivity as a non-romantic link because it's about verifying her status.

Now, moving on to preconditions related to emotional links. Preconditions are requirements that need to be satisfied for a character to perform an action. These can be emotional links or tensions. Each emotional link has a type (non-romantic or romantic) and a magnitude (-3 to 3).

For each action:

1. **Desires**: The prince wants a real princess.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Romantic
   - **Magnitude**: High, maybe +2 since it's a strong desire.

2. **Arrives**: A princess arrives at the city gate during a storm.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Non-romantic (seeking help or shelter)
   - **Magnitude**: Neutral to slightly positive (+1) as she is seeking refuge.

3. **Tests Sensitivity**: The queen tests the princess with a pea under mattresses.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Non-romantic (trust, verification)
   - **Magnitude**: Moderate (-2) since it's a test that could imply some doubt or skepticism about her claim.

4. **Feels Pain**: The princess feels pain from the pea.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Non-romantic (physical discomfort)
   - **Magnitude**: High negative (-3) as she experiences significant discomfort.

5. **Marries**: The prince marries the princess.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Romantic
   - **Magnitude**: Very high (+3) as it's a union based on confirmed romantic feelings.

6. **Places in Museum**: The pea is placed in the museum.
   - **Emotional Link Type**: Non-romantic (commemoration or recognition)
   - **Magnitude**: Neutral to slightly positive (+1) as it's more about preserving an item of significance rather than a strong emotional bond.

I need to make sure each action is in snake_case and doesn't include character names. Also, n_characters should reflect how many are involved—like 'desires' would be 1 (only the prince), while 'tests_sensitivity' involves queen and princess, so n_characters=2.

Putting it all together, I'll list actions in order, assigning each to emotional links or tensions as they fit. Since there's no major tension beyond the test, perhaps only the emotional links are prominent here.

Now, thinking about how to represent this in JSON format with preconditions for each action. Each precondition will have an array of emotional_links, and each link has type, magnitude, from, and to keys. 'from' and 'to' refer to subject ('a') and object ('b').

I need to ensure that if the action lacks a subject or object, I set it to '-', but in this case, all actions have both subject and object.

For example:

- **Action: desires**
  - `preconditions.emotional_links`:
    - type: 'romantic', magnitude: 2, from: 'a' (prince), to: 'b' (princess)

- **Action: arrives**
  - `preconditions.emotional_links`:
    - type: 'non-romantic', magnitude: 1, from: 'a' (princess), to: 'b' (city gate)

And so on for each action.

I should double-check if all actions have the necessary preconditions and that emotional links are correctly inferred based on the story's context.

This JSON structure captures each action from the story, along with preconditions that involve emotional links. Each precondition specifies the type and magnitude of the emotional link, as well as the source ('from') and target ('to') characters involved in the link.
