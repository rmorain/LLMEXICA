Alright, so I need to analyze each action from the previous JSON and identify or infer any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of two types: friendship (platonic) or love (romantic), and they have a magnitude ranging from -3 to 3.

Starting with the first action: "prince_feels_sad". The subject is the prince, and there's no object mentioned. This action suggests that the prince feels sad because he hasn't found a real princess yet. So, this feeling of sadness could be linked to his desire for love. Therefore, there might be an emotional link of type 'love' from the prince towards a potential princess, but since she isn't identified yet, it's more about his internal state rather than directed at someone else. Maybe the magnitude is around -2 because he's quite sad.

Next action: "king_opens_gate". Here, the subject is the king, and the object is the princess. The king opens the gate during a storm when the princess arrives. This seems more like an act of kindness or duty rather than driven by emotional links. So, there might not be any specific emotional link precondition here.

Third action: "queen_tests_princess". The subject is the queen, and the object is the princess. The queen sets up the pea test to determine if the princess is real. This could imply that the queen has some skepticism or maybe a mild dislike towards the princess, which might translate to a friendship link with a negative magnitude. Maybe around -1.

Fourth action: "princess_reports_bad_sleep". The subject is the princess, and she's reporting her bad sleep to someone (object). Since the princess felt the pea through multiple mattresses, it shows her sensitivity, which confirms she's a real princess. This might relate to love because it's part of proving herself for marriage. So, there could be an emotional link of type 'love' from the princess towards the prince, with a positive magnitude like +2.

Fifth action: "prince_marry_princess". Both the subject and object are the prince and princess. This is clearly driven by romantic love. The prince decides to marry her after confirming she's real, indicating a strong emotional link of type 'love' with a high magnitude, say +3 from both sides.

Putting this all together, I'll go through each action, identify if there are any emotional links that must exist for the characters to perform these actions, and assign types and magnitudes accordingly.
