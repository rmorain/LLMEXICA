Okay, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify any tensions that must exist as preconditions for those actions. The types of tension we're considering are: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. 

Starting with the first action: "prince_feels_sad". The prince is sad because he can't find a real princess. There doesn't seem to be any immediate tension like someone's life being at risk or someone being a prisoner. So, I don't think there are any tensions here.

Next action: "king_opens_gate". This happens during a storm when the princess arrives. The king opens the gate for her, but again, there isn't an explicit tension mentioned here. It seems more like a neutral action without any underlying risks or dangers.

Third action: "queen_tests_princess". The queen sets up the pea test to check if the princess is real. This could imply that there's some doubt about the princess's authenticity, which might create a mild tension. Maybe the princess’s legitimacy is at risk, but it doesn't fit into the predefined tension types directly.

Fourth action: "princess_reports_bad_sleep". The princess says she slept badly because of the pea. There’s no indication here that her life or health was at risk; it's more about discomfort, so probably no tension preconditions.

Fifth action: "prince_marry_princess". This is the resolution where the prince marries the princess after confirming she's real. Again, this is a positive outcome without any tensions involved.

Overall, I don't see any of the specified tensions (like life at risk or someone being a prisoner) in these actions. The story doesn't involve death, health risks, or imprisonment as preconditions for these actions.
