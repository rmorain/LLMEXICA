Alright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes resulting from an action, affecting either emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required per action, and if preconditions exist, they shouldn’t be the same as postconditions.

Starting with "leave_to_cool". This action likely creates a positive emotional link among the Bears due to their cooperative nature. So, a non-romantic link of trust with magnitude 1 from each Bear towards the others. There’s no tension here, so `tensions` remain empty.

Goldilocks "enter_house" introduces a potential threat. Her entrance might create a negative emotional link from the Bears towards her (non-romantic, dislike). Tension-wise, this could introduce 'life_at_risk' since she’s an intruder.

She "taste_food" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. This invasion of privacy likely creates a negative emotional link from him towards her. No immediate tension arises beyond what's already present.

When she "eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, he might feel strongly negative towards her, intensifying the emotional link to dislike or anger (magnitude -2). This action also resolves any previous 'health_at_risk' if eating all his food doesn’t cause harm, but since it’s just porridge, maybe no health risk.

Goldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it uncomfortable. This could create a mild negative emotional link towards her from him due to the intrusion. No new tensions arise here.

Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair might lead to a slight negative link from him towards Goldilocks. Again, no additional tension beyond the existing 'life_at_risk'.

Breaking Little Wee Bear’s chair escalates the situation. He might develop a stronger negative emotional link (magnitude -3) and could introduce a new tension like 'prisoner' since his property is damaged.

Sleeping in Great Big Bear’s bed comfortably creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him, but given the context, it’s more about her comfort than genuine affection. No tensions are introduced here.

She tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finds it too low, which might lead to a neutral or slightly negative link from him towards her. No new tensions arise.

Finally resting in Little Wee Bear’s bed creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him (magnitude 1), as she feels comfortable. This could resolve any previous 'discomfort' tension if it existed.

The Bears return home and express anger, discovering their porridge was tampered with. Their negative emotional links towards Goldilocks intensify (magnitude -2). The tension here is 'prisoner' as they realize an intruder has been in their house.

Checking their chairs and finding them disturbed further escalates the negative links from each Bear towards Goldilocks (magnitude -3). This also introduces or maintains a 'prisoner' tension.

Going upstairs, they find their beds have been slept in. Discovering this increases their anger, reinforcing the negative emotional links (magnitude -2). The tension here remains 'prisoner'.

When Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep, his shock intensifies the negative link towards her (magnitude -3). This confrontation heightens the 'life_at_risk' tension for both parties.

Goldilocks wakes up and sees the Bears, leading to fear. Her negative emotional link towards them becomes more intense (magnitude -3), and the 'life_at_risk' tension escalates as she realizes the danger.

She escapes through the window, likely resolving the immediate 'prisoner' tension but introducing a new 'life_at_risk' as jumping could be dangerous. The Bears no longer see her, which might reduce the 'prisoner' tension but leaves lingering negative emotional links.

Finally, not seeing Goldilocks again means the Bears might feel relief, reducing some negative emotions, but mild distrust remains (magnitude -1). Any remaining tensions like 'life_at_risk' are resolved as she’s gone.

I need to ensure each action updates both `emotional_links` and `tensions` in `postconditions`, reflecting changes from the action's outcome. Also, if an action affects emotional links or tensions, it should be clearly noted without repeating preconditions.

### Explanation:
- **Postconditions**: Each action now includes `postconditions` with updated `emotional_links` and `tensions`. These changes reflect the outcomes of each action on the characters' emotions and the narrative's tensions.
- **Emotional Links**: Positive or negative links are adjusted based on the action’s impact. For example, breaking a chair intensifies Little Wee Bear’s dislike towards Goldilocks.
- **Tensions**: Actions that resolve previous tensions (like freeing a prisoner) or introduce new ones (like increased risk) are noted. The JSON ensures that postconditions don’t mirror preconditions unless necessary.

This structured approach provides a clear progression of emotional and tensional dynamics throughout the narrative.
