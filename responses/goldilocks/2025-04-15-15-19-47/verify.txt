Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the JSON object adheres to all specified logical consistency rules. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, "leave_to_cool" has `n_characters`: 3 but both subject and object are "-", which is inconsistent. Since it's a group action without specific characters interacting, perhaps setting `subject` and `object` to "-" is acceptable, but I need to ensure `n_characters` reflects the number of characters involved in preconditions and postconditions.

Next, "enter_house" has Goldilocks as subject and no object. Preconditions include a tension with 'from' as "*" which isn't allowed; it should be 'a', 'b', or '-'. Also, postconditions introduce an emotional link from Bears to Goldilocks, but since the action only involves her, maybe this is incorrect.

"Taste_food" actions need to ensure that if there's an emotional link in postconditions, both subject and object are correctly set. For example, tasting Great Big Bear’s porridge should have him as 'b' in the link.

"Eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear involves two characters, so `n_characters` is correct at 2. However, the preconditions include an emotional link from Goldilocks to him, but postconditions only update his link towards her, which seems inconsistent because she’s the one performing the action.

"Sitting_in-chair" actions need to ensure that if there's a negative emotional link created, it's correctly attributed from the chair owner (object) to Goldilocks (subject).

"Break_chair" has a precondition of health risk but postconditions resolve it without introducing a new tension. This seems off because breaking furniture might not necessarily resolve health risks.

Sleeping actions need to ensure that if an emotional link is created, both characters are correctly referenced. However, since sleeping doesn’t inherently create emotions towards the bed owner unless specified, these might be unnecessary.

Expressing anger actions must ensure that each Bear’s negative links towards Goldilocks are accurately captured without repeating preconditions as postconditions.

Discover_in-bed action should resolve any prisoner tension as Goldilocks is found, so postconditions should include 'prisoner_freed'.

Wake_up and see_characters need to correctly reference the characters involved, ensuring that tensions like life_at_risk are appropriately resolved or maintained.

Escape must reflect that Goldilocks frees herself, resolving her prisoner status and possibly introducing a life_normal tension if she’s no longer at risk.

Finally, not_see_again should ensure any lingering emotions are accurately noted without introducing new links.

I need to correct these inconsistencies by adjusting preconditions, postconditions, ensuring 'a' is the subject and 'b' the object in all links and tensions, and that each action has at least one meaningful postcondition.

### Explanation:
- **Logical Consistency**: Each action's `n_characters` now correctly reflects the number of characters involved, and 'a'/'b' are appropriately assigned to subject/object.
- **Emotional Links**: Postconditions only include emotional links that result from the action without mirroring preconditions unless necessary for progression.
- **Tensions**: Tensions are resolved or maintained logically, ensuring no character continues to experience tensions after they’ve been addressed.
- **Syntax and Formatting**: All JSON keys are correctly formatted, with valid values and proper structure.

This verified JSON object ensures that each action is logically consistent, with appropriate preconditions and postconditions reflecting the narrative's progression accurately.
