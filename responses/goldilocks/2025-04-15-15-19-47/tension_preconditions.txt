Alright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like 'character_dead', 'life_at_risk', 'health_at_risk', or 'prisoner'. These tensions must exist for an action to make sense.

Starting with the first action: "leave_to_cool". This is just the Bears leaving their porridge, so no tension is required here. The array remains empty.

Next, Goldilocks "enter_house". For her to enter, there might be a risk of her life if she’s trespassing, but since nothing happens immediately, maybe no tension is needed. Alternatively, entering someone else's house could imply a potential risk, so perhaps 'life_at_risk' with herself as the source and target.

She then "taste_food" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. Tasting porridge doesn’t inherently involve tension unless it's too hot or cold, which isn't the case here. So no tension is needed.

When she "eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, eating all his porridge might cause him distress later, but at this point, there's no immediate tension. So again, no preconditions related to tension are necessary.

Goldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. This action doesn’t introduce any tension; it’s just about comfort. Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about preference for softness, so no tension here either.

However, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could lead to a 'health_at_risk' situation if the broken chair causes injury. So, a tension of type 'health_at_risk' from Goldilocks to herself or others.

She then sleeps in Great Big Bear’s bed and finds it too high. Sleeping doesn’t inherently cause tension unless it leads to something risky, but in this case, it's just discomfort. So no tension is required here.

Trying Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finding it too low might not involve tension either; it’s about comfort again. But when she finally rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's comfortable, there’s no immediate tension unless her presence later causes a problem. For now, no tension is needed.

The Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. This action doesn’t directly involve tension unless the anger leads to conflict. Since they’re upset but haven’t confronted Goldilocks yet, maybe no tension is required here.

They check their chairs and find them disturbed, which makes them suspicious. Suspicion could imply that someone unauthorized has been there, leading to a potential 'prisoner' tension if they think an intruder is still present. So, perhaps a 'prisoner' type tension from the Bears towards Goldilocks.

Going upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. This discovery heightens the tension as they realize someone is or has been in their house. This could be another 'prisoner' type tension since Goldilocks is an intruder.

When Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks asleep, this confrontation introduces a direct threat. Goldilocks’s presence becomes a 'life_at_risk' tension for herself as she might face danger from the Bears or vice versa.

Goldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This fear escalates the tension to 'life_at_risk' as both parties are now aware of each other and a confrontation is imminent.

She escapes through the window, which definitely involves 'life_at_risk' since jumping from a window can be dangerous. The tension here is clear and present.

Finally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, but there might still be lingering tensions like 'prisoner' if they believe she’s still around or if they’re wary of future intrusions.

So, compiling these thoughts, I need to add a `tensions` array under `preconditions` for each action where applicable, specifying the type and the source and target characters.

### Explanation:
- **Tensions**: Each action now includes a `tensions` array under `preconditions`. These tensions indicate the type of risk or threat present, with sources and targets specified.
- **Types**: Tensions include 'life_at_risk' when there's potential danger and 'prisoner' when an intruder is detected. 'health_at_risk' is noted if physical harm is possible.
- **Sources and Targets**: These are defined to show which character is causing or experiencing the tension, using 'a' for the subject and 'b' for the object, with '*' indicating any character.

This structured JSON object now captures both emotional links and tensions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative’s dynamics.
