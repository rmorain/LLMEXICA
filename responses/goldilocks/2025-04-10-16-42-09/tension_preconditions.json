Okay, so now I need to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this in JSON, including adding a `tensions` array within the `preconditions` key. Each tension should have a type (like life_at_risk), and specify who is the source (`from`) and target (`to`).

First, I'll go through each action identified earlier:

1. **goldilocks_enters_house**: This action doesn't inherently involve any tension since Goldilocks is just entering an empty house. So, the `tensions` array should be empty.

2. **bears_find_tampered_porridge**: The bears discover that someone has been at their porridge, which introduces a tension as they realize their property has been invaded. This could relate to their life or well-being indirectly, so perhaps a `life_at_risk` tension from the source of the tampering (unknown person) to themselves.

3. **goldilocks_wakes_up**: Goldilocks wakes up because she hears the bears, but this action itself doesn't create a new tension; it's more of a reaction. So, no specific tensions here unless we infer that her waking up leads to potential danger, which could be `life_at_risk` for herself.

4. **goldilocks_jumps_out_window**: This action clearly puts Goldilocks' life at risk as she jumps out the window, fitting the `life_at_risk` tension. The source is herself (a) and the target is also herself (a).

Now, applying this to each action:

1. For "goldilocks_enters_house":
   ```json
   {
     "action": "goldilocks_enters_house",
     "n_characters": 1,
     "subject": "-",
     "object": "-",
     "preconditions": {
       "emotional_links": [],
       "tensions": []
     }
   }
   ```

2. For "bears_find_tampered_porridge":
   ```json
   {
     "action": "bears_find_tampered_porridge",
     "n_characters": 3,
     "subject": "the_three_bears",
     "object": "-",
     "preconditions": {
       "emotional_links": [],
       "tensions": [
         {
           "type": "life_at_risk",
           "from": "*",
           "to": "a"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
   Here, `from` is "*" indicating any character (the unknown intruder), and `to` is "a" referring to the bears.

3. For "goldilocks_wakes_up":
   ```json
   {
     "action": "goldilocks_wakes_up",
     "n_characters": 1,
     "subject": "goldilocks",
     "object": "-",
     "preconditions": {
       "emotional_links": [],
       "tensions": []
     }
   }
   ```

4. For "goldilocks_jumps_out_window":
   ```json
   {
     "action": "goldilocks_jumps_out_window",
     "n_characters": 1,
     "subject": "goldilocks",
     "object": "-",
     "preconditions": {
       "emotional_links": [
         {
           "type": "friendship",
           "magnitude": -2,
           "from": "a",
           "to": "b"
         }
       ],
       "tensions": [
         {
           "type": "life_at_risk",
           "from": "a",
           "to": "a"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
   Here, the tension is `life_at_risk` with both `from` and `to` as "a" (Goldilocks herself).

I think this accurately captures the tensions that serve as preconditions for each action in the story.
