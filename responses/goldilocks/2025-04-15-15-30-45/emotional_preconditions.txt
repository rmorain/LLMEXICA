Alright, I need to tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and they want me to analyze it from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions in the story.

First, let's understand what's being asked. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic. Given the context of this classic fairy tale, there are no romantic interactions, so I'll focus solely on non-romantic emotional links. Tensions include things like a character dying, their life being at risk, health issues, or imprisonment.

The story goes like this: Goldilocks enters the bears' house while they're out. She tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, and sleeps in Baby Bear's bed. The bears return home to find their porridge has been tasted, chairs sat in, and someone sleeping in Baby Bear's bed. They confront Goldilocks, who then flees.

Now, I need to extract actions from this story that relate to emotional links and tensions. Each action should be labeled in a simple, abstract way without mentioning specific characters, using snake_case. For each action, I'll note the subject (who performs it) and object (who receives it). If there's no subject or object, I'll use '-'.

After extracting these actions, I need to verify that they accurately reflect the story. Then, for each action, identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Preconditions are emotional states that must exist for an action to make sense. For example, if a character attacks another, there might be a precondition of hatred (non-romantic link with magnitude -3).

Let's start by listing potential actions from the story:

1. Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge.
2. Goldilocks tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.
3. Goldilocks tastes Little Wee Bear's porridge and eats it all.
4. Goldilocks sits in Great Big Bear's chair (too hard).
5. Goldilocks sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair (too soft).
6. Goldilocks sits in Little Wee Bear's chair until it breaks.
7. Goldilocks lies down in Great Big Bear's bed (too high at the head).
8. Goldilocks lies down in Middle-sized Bear's bed (too high at the foot).
9. Goldilocks lies down in Little Wee Bear's bed and falls asleep.
10. The bears return home and find their porridge disturbed.
11. Great Big Bear notices his spoon in the porridge.
12. Middle-sized Bear notices his spoon in the porridge.
13. Little Wee Bear notices his porridge is gone.
14. Bears investigate further and find their chairs disturbed.
15. Great Big Bear's chair cushion was not straight.
16. Middle-sized Bear's chair cushion was squashed.
17. Little Wee Bear's chair bottom broke.
18. Bears go upstairs to check the beds.
19. Great Big Bear notices his pillow moved.
20. Middle-sized Bear notices his bolster moved.
21. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed.
22. Goldilocks wakes up, sees the bears, and jumps out the window.

Now, I need to translate these into the required JSON format. Each action should have 'action', 'n_characters' (number of characters involved), 'subject', and 'object'. If either is missing, use '-'.

Let's start mapping:

1. tastes_porridge: Goldilocks as subject, Great Big Bear as object.
2. tastes_porridge: Goldilocks as subject, Middle-sized Bear as object.
3. eats_porridge: Goldilocks as subject, Little Wee Bear as object (since she ate it all).
4. sits_in_chair: Goldilocks as subject, Great Big Bear as object.
5. sits_in_chair: Goldilocks as subject, Middle-sized Bear as object.
6. sits_in_chair: Goldilocks as subject, Little Wee Bear as object.
7. lies_in_bed: Goldilocks as subject, Great Big Bear as object.
8. lies_in_bed: Goldilocks as subject, Middle-sized Bear as object.
9. sleeps: Goldilocks as subject, Little Wee Bear's bed as object? Wait, objects should be characters, so maybe '-' since she's sleeping in the bed, not interacting directly with a character yet.
10. investigate: Bears as subjects, house as object? No, need to involve characters. Maybe they check porridge and chairs, but these are objects. So perhaps no direct actions here.
11. notices_spoon: Great Big Bear as subject, porridge (object is '-').
12. notices_spoon: Middle-sized Bear as subject, porridge ('-').
13. notices_porridge_missing: Little Wee Bear as subject, porridge ('-').
14. investigate_chairs: Bears as subjects, chairs as objects ('-').
15. notices_cushion: Great Big Bear, cushion ('-').
16. notices_cushion: Middle-sized Bear, cushion ('-').
17. notices_broken-chair: Little Wee Bear, chair ('-').
18. go_upstairs: Bears as subjects, bedchamber as object ('-').
19. notices_pillow: Great Big Bear, pillow ('-').
20. notices_bolster: Middle-sized Bear, bolster ('-').
21. finds_goldilocks: Little Wee Bear as subject, Goldilocks as object.
22. wakes_up: Goldilocks as subject, herself as object (since she's waking up).
23. sees_bears: Goldilocks as subject, bears as objects.
24. jumps_out_window: Goldilocks as subject, window ('-').

Wait, I need to ensure that 'subject' and 'object' are characters, not inanimate objects. So actions involving porridge, chairs, beds should have '-' for object unless directly interacting with a character.

So refining:

1. tastes_porridge: subject=Goldilocks, object=Great Big Bear.
2. tastes_porridge: subject=Goldilocks, object=Middle-sized Bear.
3. eats_porridge: subject=Goldilocks, object=Little Wee Bear.
4. sits_in_chair: subject=Goldilocks, object=Great Big Bear.
5. sits_in_chair: subject=Goldilocks, object=Middle-sized Bear.
6. sits_in_chair: subject=Goldilocks, object=Little Wee Bear.
7. lies_in_bed: subject=Goldilocks, object=Great Big Bear.
8. lies_in_bed: subject=Goldilocks, object=Middle-sized Bear.
9. sleeps: subject=Goldilocks, object='-'
10. investigate: subject=Bears, object='-'
11. notices_spoon: subject=Great Big Bear, object='-'
12. notices_spoon: subject=Middle-sized Bear, object='-'
13. notices_porridge_missing: subject=Little Wee Bear, object='-'
14. investigate_chairs: subject=Bears, object='-'
15. notices_cushion: subject=Great Big Bear, object='-'
16. notices_cushion: subject=Middle-sized Bear, object='-'
17. notices_broken-chair: subject=Little Wee Bear, object='-'
18. go_upstairs: subject=Bears, object='-'
19. notices_pillow: subject=Great Big Bear, object='-'
20. notices_bolster: subject=Middle-sized Bear, object='-'
21. finds_goldilocks: subject=Little Wee Bear, object=Goldilocks.
22. wakes_up: subject=Goldilocks, object='-'
23. sees_bears: subject=Goldilocks, object=Bears.
24. jumps_out_window: subject=Goldilocks, object='-'

Now, I need to check each action for preconditions related to emotional links. For example, why did Goldilocks taste the porridge? Maybe curiosity or rudeness, which could imply a non-romantic link with a negative magnitude towards the bears.

Similarly, when she breaks the chair and later flees upon seeing the bears, that implies fear (negative emotional link) towards them.

For each action:

1. tastes_porridge: Goldilocks' curiosity or rudeness (non-romantic, maybe -1)
2. sits_in_chair: same as above
3. eats_porridge: same
4. lies_in_bed: same
5. breaks chair: her carelessness leading to an accident (health risk)
6. sleeps: tiredness from earlier actions
7. finds_goldilocks: Little Wee Bear's surprise or anger upon finding an intruder (non-romantic, maybe -2)
8. wakes_up: fear upon seeing the bears (non-romantic, -3)
9. jumps_out_window: desperation to escape (health risk)

Now, structuring this into JSON with preconditions for emotional links where applicable.

Each action's precondition should specify any required emotional link. For example:

For 'tastes_porridge', Goldilocks has a non-romantic link towards the bears with magnitude -1 (rudeness).

Similarly, when she breaks the chair, her carelessness implies a negative link.

When Little Wee Bear finds her, his anger implies a negative link towards Goldilocks.

When Goldilocks wakes up and sees the bears, her fear implies a strong negative link.

I'll need to map these preconditions for each action accordingly.

This JSON structure captures the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. Each action includes preconditions where applicable, indicating the necessary emotional states that drive the characters' behaviors.
