Alright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links between characters (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character death, life at risk, health risks, or imprisonment.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks enters the bears' house, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, and sleeps in their bed. The bears come home to find their things disturbed and eventually discover Goldilocks asleep.

Looking for emotional links: There are no romantic interactions here, so I'll focus on non-romantic links. The main interactions are between Goldilocks and each of the bears. However, since Goldilocks is interacting with their belongings rather than directly with them, it might not count as direct emotional links. But when the bears find their porridge and chairs messed up, that's a point where they show concern or anger towards someone (Goldilocks) who has affected them.

Tensions in the story: The primary tension seems to be Goldilocks being an intruder and causing trouble, but does it fit any of the specified types? She breaks the chair, which could risk her health if she falls, so maybe 'health_at_risk' when she plummets. Also, when she's asleep in the bed and the bears find her, there's a confrontation that could lead to life being at risk.

Now, identifying actions:

1. Goldilocks tastes each bear's porridge. Since this is about tasting, it's an action directed towards each bear's property, but since we need subject and object as characters, maybe 'tastes_porridge' with the respective bear as object.

2. She sits in their chairs, which breaks for the Little Wee Bear. So actions like 'sits_in-chair'.

3. She sleeps in the bed and is found by the bears. The action here could be 'lies_in_bed'.

4. When she falls from the chair, that's a health risk, so an action of 'falls' with herself as both subject and object.

5. Upon being discovered, Goldilocks runs away, which could involve jumping out the window, possibly risking her life or health. So actions like 'jumps_out_window'.

I need to structure these in chronological order, using the specified JSON format. Each action should have n_characters (number of characters involved), subject, and object.

Wait, but when Goldilocks is tasting porridge, she's interacting with the bears' belongings. Since we're only considering actions where both subject and object are characters, maybe that doesn't count because the porridge is an object. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on direct interactions between characters. However, in this story, there aren't any direct interactions until the end when Goldilocks is discovered.

So maybe the key actions related to emotional links are the bears discovering their things were disturbed and reacting towards Goldilocks. But since they don't directly interact with her until she's asleep, perhaps those are the main points.

Alternatively, I might have misunderstood. Maybe any action where a character affects another's property counts as an action towards them, even if indirectly. So, for example, 'tastes_porridge' of Great Big Bear would be an action by Goldilocks directed at his porridge, implying she's affecting him through that.

I think I'll proceed with including those actions since they establish the emotional links (the bears are upset because someone messed with their things). Similarly, when she sits in their chairs and breaks one, it shows her impact on them. Finally, lying in the bed directly relates to the Little Wee Bear's space.

Now, considering tensions:

- When Goldilocks falls from the chair, that's a health risk for her.
- When she jumps out the window, that's another health or life risk.

I should include these as tension-related actions. So 'falls' and 'jumps_out_window' would be under health_at_risk or life_at_risk.

Putting it all together, I'll list each action in order with their subject, object, and n_characters.
