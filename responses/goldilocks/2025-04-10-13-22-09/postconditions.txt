Alright, I need to analyze each action in the story and identify the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that occur as a result of an action. They must not be the same as preconditions if those exist.

Let me go through each action one by one:

1. **Action: taste_porridge**
   - **Subject:** Goldilocks
   - **Object:** Bears' porridge
   - This is the first interaction, so no prior emotional links. After tasting, Goldilocks might have a neutral or slightly positive feeling towards the bears for their food, but since she doesn't know them, it's minimal.

2. **Action: sit_in Chair**
   - **Subject:** Goldilocks
   - **Object:** Bears' chairs
   - She sits in each chair and finds one comfortable. This might create a slight positive emotional link towards the Little Wee Bear, whose chair she liked.

3. **Action: sleep_in_bed**
   - **Subject:** Goldilocks
   - **Object:** Little Wee Bear's bed
   - After sleeping comfortably, she might develop a slightly positive feeling towards the Little Wee Bear for having a nice bed.

4. **Action: find_spoon_in_porridge (Great Big Bear)**
   - **Subject:** Great Big Bear
   - **Object:** His porridge
   - Discovering someone ate his porridge likely creates a negative emotional link from the Great Big Bear towards Goldilocks, as he feels violated.

5. **Action: find_spoon_in_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**
   - Similar to the previous action, the Middle-sized Bear becomes upset and forms a negative emotional link towards Goldilocks.

6. **Action: find_empty_porridge_bowl (Little Wee Bear)**
   - The Little Wee Bear is angry about his porridge being eaten entirely, leading to a strong negative emotional link towards Goldilocks.

7. **Action: investigate_house**
   - The Bears are suspicious and start searching, increasing their negative emotions towards the unknown intruder (Goldilocks).

8. **Action: find_disarranged_cushion (Great Big Bear)**
   - Finding his cushion moved angers the Great Big Bear more, intensifying his negative emotional link towards Goldilocks.

9. **Action: find_squashed_cushion (Middle-sized Bear)**
   - The Middle-sized Bear becomes annoyed, strengthening his negative feelings towards Goldilocks.

10. **Action: find_broken_chair (Little Wee Bear)**
    - Discovering the broken chair makes the Little Wee Bear very angry, deepening his negative emotional link towards Goldilocks.

11. **Action: search_bedroom**
    - The Bears are now thoroughly investigating, driven by growing anger and suspicion, reinforcing their negative emotions towards Goldilocks.

12. **Action: find_displaced_pillow (Great Big Bear)**
    - Finding his pillow moved adds to the Great Big Bear's irritation, intensifying his negative emotional link.

13. **Action: find_displaced_bolster (Middle-sized Bear)**
    - The Middle-sized Bear is similarly annoyed, strengthening his negative feelings towards Goldilocks.

14. **Action: find_goldilocks_in_bed**
    - Finally discovering Goldilocks in bed leads to the peak of negative emotions from all three bears towards her, solidifying their strong negative emotional links.

For tensions, each action after the initial intrusion escalates the Bears' sense of threat or risk. For example, finding porridge disturbed leads to `life_at_risk` tension as they feel unsafe. Discovering someone in their bed heightens this tension. When Goldilocks escapes, it could resolve some tensions like `prisoner`.

Now, I'll map each action's postconditions based on these observations.
