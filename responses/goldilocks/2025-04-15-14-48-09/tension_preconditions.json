Alright, so I need to figure out how to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story. The user provided a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and previously, we identified one action: "goldilocks_jumps_out_window" with tension type "life_at_risk". 

First, I should understand what tensions are according to the problem statement. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. These represent situations where a character is in some form of jeopardy or distress.

Now, for each action, I need to determine if there are any preconditions related to tensions. Preconditions mean that certain tension conditions must exist before the action can occur. For example, if Goldilocks jumps out the window because her life is at risk, then "life_at_risk" would be a precondition.

Looking back at the story, when Goldilocks wakes up and sees the Three Bears, she panics and jumps out the window. This action is driven by the tension where her life is at riskâ€”she fears being harmed or punished by the Bears. Therefore, the precondition for this action is that her life is at risk.

So, in the JSON structure, under `preconditions`, I need to add a `tensions` key with an array of tension objects. Each tension object should specify the type and the source (`from`) and recipient (`to`). Since Goldilocks is the one whose life is at risk, the `from` would be 'a' (the subject) and `to` would also be 'a'.

I need to ensure that I'm following the correct syntax and structure as per the instructions. Each tension object within the array should have keys for type, from, and to.

Finally, since there are no emotional links involved in this action, the `emotional_links` array remains empty.
