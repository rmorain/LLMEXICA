Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze each action in terms of tensions for this Goldilocks and the Three Bears story. The user wants me to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions that need to exist for each action to make sense.

First, let's recall what tensions are defined as:
1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

Now, I'll go through each action and see if any of these tensions apply as preconditions.

1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. There’s no immediate tension here; she's just curious. So, no tensions as preconditions.

2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, this is more about her hunger or curiosity, not any existing tension.

3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No tension here; she’s exploring the house.

4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Similar to above, just testing comfort.

5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This could introduce a `life_at_risk` or `health_at_risk` tension for Goldilocks because she falls and might get hurt.

6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. No inherent tension here; it’s about comfort.

7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Again, just seeking comfort.

8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. This leads to the Bears finding her later, which could introduce a `prisoner` tension if they decide to detain her.

9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could lead to `clashing_emotions` as they become upset about their property being disturbed.

10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. This adds to the tension of someone being in their house uninvited, possibly leading to `life_at_risk` if they think there's an intruder.

11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is a key moment where tensions like `prisoner` (if they decide to hold her) or `clashing_emotions` because of their anger and surprise come into play.

12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. The noise startles her, leading to tension as she realizes she's been discovered, possibly fearing for her safety (`life_at_risk`).

13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window. This action clearly puts her `life_at_risk` because falling from a height could cause injury.

Now, I need to map these tensions as preconditions where applicable. Most of the early actions don't have tension preconditions except for when she breaks the chair and when they discover her, leading to escape and potential harm.
