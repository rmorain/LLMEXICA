Alright, so now I need to analyze each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions are specific situations that create suspense or conflict, such as a character's life being at risk, their health being in jeopardy, or them being imprisoned.

First, let me recall the types of tensions we're considering:

1. **character_dead**: A character has died.
2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.
3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.
4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.

Given the story, none of these tensions are explicitly present except for when Goldilocks jumps out of the window, which could put her life at risk. However, I need to carefully consider each action to see if any implicit tensions exist that might serve as preconditions for those actions.

Let's go through each action one by one:

1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:
   - This action involves Goldilocks tasting the porridge. There’s no direct tension here; it's more about curiosity or rudeness.
   
2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Similar to above, just another iteration with a different bear.

3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - Goldilocks eats all of the Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Again, no immediate tension unless we consider that her actions might lead to consequences later.

4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**:
   - She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair, which is too hard for her. No direct tension here.

5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Sits in Middle-sized Bear’s chair, which is too soft. Still no tension.

6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - She sits in Little Wee Bear's chair and breaks it. This could potentially lead to a situation where she injures herself or causes damage, but in the story, she just gets cross.

7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear’s bed. No immediate tension, but later on, this leads to her being discovered.

8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:
   - The Great Big Bear finds that someone has been at his porridge. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could be considered a tension related to security or property.

9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Similar to above; the Middle-sized Bear discovers his porridge was tampered with.

10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - Little Wee Bear finds that someone has eaten all his porridge, which is more serious than just being tasted.

11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**:
    - The Great Big Bear notices someone sat in his chair, adding to the sense of intrusion.

12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**:
    - Middle-sized Bear finds his chair was tampered with.

13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - Little Wee Bear discovers that someone not only sat in but also broke his chair, which introduces a situation where property damage has occurred.

14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - This is the most significant tension. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, which directly puts Goldilocks at risk as she is caught trespassing and must flee.

15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**:
    - Goldilocks wakes up to the Bears’ voices. This is more of a reaction than a precondition for tension.

16. **flee (Goldilocks)**:
    - Finally, when Goldilocks flees by jumping out the window, this action inherently puts her life at risk, fitting the **life_at_risk** tension type.

Given these observations:

- **find_in_bed**: This action directly leads to a tension where Goldilocks’ life is at risk as she realizes she has been caught and must escape.
  
- **flee**: The act of fleeing introduces a clear tension of **life_at_risk** as jumping out the window could result in injury or worse.

For other actions, while there are elements of intrusion and property tampering, these don’t directly map to the predefined tension types unless we consider them under broader categories like security breaches. However, since the user has specified particular tensions, I will focus on those.

Therefore, only the **find_in_bed** and **flee** actions have direct preconditions related to tensions.
