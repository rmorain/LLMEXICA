Okay, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed structure with actions and emotional links, and now they want me to enhance it by identifying any tensions that must exist as preconditions for these actions.

First, I need to understand what tensions are defined here. Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. These represent situations where a character is in some form of jeopardy or distress.

Next, I should go through each action and determine if any tension must exist for the action to make sense. This means looking at why a character would perform an action based on the presence of certain tensions.

Let me start with the first action: "taste_porridge" where Goldilocks is the subject and Great Big Bear is the object. Is there any tension that needs to exist for her to taste his porridge? Not really; she’s just curious or hungry, so no specific tension drives this action.

The second action: "taste_porridge" with Middle-sized Bear. Similar reasoning applies here—no inherent tension required for her to taste the porridge.

Third action: "eat_porridge," where Goldilocks eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, this is driven by hunger or preference, not by any existing tension.

Fourth action: "sit_in-chair" with Great Big Bear. She sits because she’s tired or curious; no specific tension is needed here.

Fifth action: "sit_in-chair" with Middle-sized Bear. Same as before—no tension required for her to sit.

Sixth action: "break_chair," which happens when she breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This could imply some frustration, but not necessarily a predefined tension like life at risk or health issues.

Seventh action: "lie_in-bed" with Great Big Bear. She lies down because she’s tired; no specific tension is required here.

Eighth action: "lie_in-bed" with Middle-sized Bear. Again, just seeking rest—no inherent tension.

Ninth action: "sleep_in_bed," where Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed. This action doesn’t imply any tension; it’s more about seeking comfort or sleep.

So, going through all these actions, I don't see any tensions that need to exist as preconditions for these actions. The motivations are more about curiosity, hunger, tiredness, etc., rather than specific tensions like someone's life being at risk or health issues.

Therefore, for each action, the `tensions` array should be empty since there are no required tensions for these actions.
