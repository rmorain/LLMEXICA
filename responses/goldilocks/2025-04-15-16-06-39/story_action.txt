Alright, let me try to break down how I would approach analyzing this story using the guidelines provided.

First, I need to identify all the actions that relate to emotional links or tensions in the narrative. Emotional links are either non-romantic or romantic, but since there's no romance here, I'll focus on non-romantic interactions. Tensions include things like characters being dead, life at risk, health at risk, or prisoner.

Looking at the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, I notice that the main actions are Goldilocks interacting with the Bears' property: porridge, chairs, beds. Each time she does something, it affects the Bears, creating tension because they come home to find their things disturbed.

I'll list each action in order, making sure each is simple and general. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, that's 'tastes_porridge' with her as subject and him as object. I also need to track the number of characters involved, so for actions like tasting or sitting where only she's involved, n_characters would be 1.

I should ensure not to include any inanimate objects as subjects or objects, focusing solely on character interactions. Also, if an action doesn't have a subject or object (like some of Goldilocks' solo actions), I'll mark those with '-'.

Finally, I need to structure this into JSON format, ensuring each entry has the correct keys and values without any extra information beyond what's specified.

Here is the structured analysis of the story in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "taste_porridge",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Goldilocks",
    "object": "Great Big Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "taste_porridge",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Goldilocks",
    "object": "Middle-sized Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "eat_porridge",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Goldilocks",
    "object": "Little Wee Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "sit_in-chair",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Goldilocks",
    "object": "Great Big Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "sit_in-chair",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Goldilocks",
    "object": "Middle-sized Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "break_chair",

    "object": "Great Big Bear"
  },
  {
    "action": "lie_in_bed",
