Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the JSON object is logically consistent and adheres to all specified constraints. Let me go through each action one by one.

First, for actions where `n_characters` is 1, only 'a' should be used in emotional links and tensions. But looking at the current JSON, all actions have `n_characters` set to 2 because both `subject` and `object` are characters. So that's consistent.

Next, if a character dies, they shouldn't have any further emotional connections or tensions. In this story, no one dies, so that's not an issue here.

I also need to make sure that preconditions and postconditions aren't the same. For each action, I'll check that any emotional links in `postconditions` are different from those in `preconditions`. Since all `preconditions` have empty emotional links, this is satisfied.

Emotional link types are correct: 'non-romantic' since there's no romance involved.

Now, checking the JSON syntax. Each emotional link has keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`, and each tension has `type`, `from`, and `to`. All number values are valid JSON without any `+` prefixes.

The `subject` and `object` are correctly set to character names, and `n_characters` is 2 for all actions since both characters are involved. No emotional links have '-' as `subject` or `object`.

Finally, each action has at least one postcondition, so none need to be removed.

Overall, everything seems consistent and correct.

Here is the verified and corrected JSON object:
