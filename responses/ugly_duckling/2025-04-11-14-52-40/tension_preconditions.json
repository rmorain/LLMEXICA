Alright, I need to analyze each action in "The Ugly Duckling" story and identify preconditions related to tensions. The user has defined four types of tension: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. 

Starting with the first action, "is_cared_for". This is about the mother duck caring for her ducklings. There's no inherent tension here; it's a nurturing act. So, tensions are empty.

Next, "hatches_from_egg" â€“ just the duckling emerging, no tension involved.

Third action: "is_rejected_by". The other ducks reject him because he's ugly. This isn't directly a tension but more about emotional links. So, tensions remain empty here.

Fourth action: "introduces_to_others". Again, introducing doesn't inherently imply tension unless there's a specific conflict. Since it's just an introduction, no tension is present.

Fifth action: "is_bitten_by". The ducks bite him, which could imply `life_at_risk` since physical harm is involved. So, the subject (other_ducks) causes life risk to the object (ugly_duckling).

Sixth action: "runs_away_from". The duckling runs away because he feels unsafe or rejected. This implies `life_at_risk` as he's escaping potential danger.

Seventh action: "meets_wild_geese". Just a meeting, no tension here.

Eighth action: "is_shot_at". Hunters shooting at him directly relates to `life_at_risk`.

Ninth action: "hides_from_hunters". Hiding from hunters indicates `life_at_risk` as he's trying to avoid being shot.

Tenth action: "seeks_shelter_in_cottage". Seeking shelter is more about safety but doesn't inherently imply tension unless the environment is dangerous. Since it's just seeking shelter, tensions are empty.

Eleventh action: "feels_unwelcome_by". Feeling unwelcome relates more to emotional links than tension. So, no specific tension here.

Twelfth action: "leaves_cottage". Leaving because he feels unwelcome doesn't inherently involve tension unless there's a direct threat. Since it's more about his feelings, tensions remain empty.

Thirteenth action: "finds_water_but_is_avoided". Being avoided by others isn't a direct tension but more of an emotional link issue.

Fourteenth action: "struggles_through_winter". This implies `health_at_risk` due to harsh weather conditions and lack of proper care.

Fifteenth action: "is_rescued_from_ice_by". The duckling is rescued from freezing, indicating `health_at_risk` before the rescue.

Sixteenth action: "escapes_peasants_home". Escaping might imply `life_at_risk` if there's a threat, but since it's not clear, I'll assume no tension here.

Seventeenth action: "joins_swan_flock". A positive action without inherent tension. So, tensions are empty.

I think I've covered all the actions and identified where tensions act as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the potential risks involved.
