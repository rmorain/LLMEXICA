Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions on how to analyze actions in "The Ugly Duckling" story, focusing on preconditions related to emotional links. My task is to identify these preconditions for each action and structure them in the specified JSON format.

First, I need to understand what a precondition is in this context. From the user's explanation, it seems that a precondition is an emotional state or link that must exist between characters for a specific action to make sense. Each emotional link has a type (friendship or love) and a magnitude ranging from -3 to 3.

I'll start by reviewing each action identified earlier and determine if there are any emotional links that must be present before the action occurs.

1. **mother_duck_sits_on_nest**
   - The mother duck's action of sitting on the nest is driven by her maternal instincts, indicating a strong love for her unborn ducklings.
   
2. **large_egg_hatches**
   - This event doesn't involve emotional links but is more about tension (health_at_risk). So no preconditions here.

3. **mother_duck_takes_brood_to_water**
   - The mother's action to take the brood to water suggests care and protection, indicating love towards her ducklings.

4. **ducklings_mock_and_bite_ugly_duckling**
   - The other ducklings mock because they dislike the ugly duckling, showing a negative friendship link (hatred).

5. **mother_defends_duckling**
   - The mother defends him out of love and protection, indicating a positive emotional link towards her child.

6. **duckling_runs_away_from_farmyard**
   - The ugly duckling feels rejected, implying the absence or negative emotional links with others.

7. **wild_ducks_mock_duckling**
   - Similar to the previous action, wild ducks mock due to dislike (negative friendship).

8. **sportsmen_shoot_at_waterfowl**
   - This is about tension (life_at_risk), not emotional links, so no preconditions here.

9. **dog_chases_duckling**
   - The dog's chase is driven by instinct rather than emotional links, so no precondition needed.

10. **duckling_escapes_to_cottage**
    - The duckling seeks shelter out of necessity rather than emotional reasons, so no precondition.

11. **hen_and_cat_reject_duckling**
    - Rejection implies a negative emotional link from the hen and cat towards the duckling.

12. **duckling_faces_harsh_winter**
    - This is about surviving harsh conditions (tension), not emotional links.

13. **peasant_rescues_duckling_from_ice**
    - The peasant's action is driven by kindness, indicating a positive emotional link towards the duckling.

14. **children_frighten_duckling**
    - Fear from the children implies a negative emotional link towards the duckling.

15. **duckling_discovers_reflection_in_water**
    - This is about self-realization, so no preconditions needed.

16. **swans_welcome_duckling**
    - The swans' acceptance indicates positive friendship or love towards him.

17. **children_accept_and_feed_swan**
    - Children's acceptance shows a positive emotional link towards the swan.

Now, I'll map each action to its preconditions, considering the required format. For each action, if there are no emotional links, the array will be empty. Otherwise, I'll define the type, magnitude, and direction (from/to) based on the analysis above.
