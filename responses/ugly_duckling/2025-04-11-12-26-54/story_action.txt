Okay, so I need to analyze this story called "The Ugly Duckling" by Hans Christian Andersen. The user has given me specific instructions on how to approach this task. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the goal is to extract essential actions from the main characters, focusing on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). I need to organize these actions in chronological order in a JSON format. Each action should be simple, avoid character names, use snake_case, and include keys like n_characters, subject, object.

Alright, let's start by reading the story carefully. It's about a duckling who is rejected because he looks different but later finds acceptance as a swan. The main characters are the mother duck, the ugly duckling (who becomes a swan), other ducks, geese, and various animals like cats, hens, etc.

I need to identify actions related to emotional links and tensions. Emotional links could be interactions where friendship or love is shown or lacking. Tensions involve situations where characters are in danger or confined.

Let me go through the story chapter by chapter.

1. The duckling is born last and is considered ugly. His mother is tired but continues to care for him.
   - Action: Mother sits on nest, hatches egg. Emotional link: love (mother's care). Tension: health_at_risk (egg not hatching).
   
2. The duckling joins the other ducklings in water. He swims well, but his appearance is questioned by others.
   - Action: Mother takes brood to water. Emotional link: friendship/love (mother introducing him). Tension: life_at_risk as they swim.

3. In the farmyard, the duckling faces rejection and bullying from other ducks and poultry.
   - Actions: Ducks mock him, bite his neck. Emotional links: lack of friendship. Tensions: health_at_risk, life_at_risk (being bitten).

4. The mother defends him but eventually, he is driven away by others.
   - Action: Mother tries to comfort him. Emotional link: love. But then the duckling leaves because of bullying.

5. He meets wild ducks on a moor who also reject him.
   - Action: Wild ducks stare and mock. No emotional links; tension from rejection.

6. Sportsmen (hunters) come, causing danger with guns and dogs.
   - Actions: Shots fired, dog chases duckling. Tensions: life_at_risk, health_at_risk.

7. He escapes to a cottage but is rejected by the hen and cat who don't understand him.
   - Action: Duckling asks for shelter. Emotional link attempted (friendship) but fails. Tension: prisoner? No, he's just confined temporarily.

8. The duckling continues his journey, faces harsh winter, almost freezes to death.
   - Actions: He struggles in cold, ice forms. Tensions: health_at_risk, life_at_risk.

9. A peasant rescues him but the children frighten him.
   - Action: Peasant breaks ice, saves him. Emotional link: kindness (love). Then tension as he's frightened by kids.

10. In spring, he sees swans and finds his true identity.
    - Actions: He approaches swans, sees reflection. Emotional links: self-love/acceptance. Tension resolved when he finds his place.

11. Children accept him, old swans welcome him.
    - Actions: Swans stroke him, children feed him. Emotional links: friendship and love from others.

Now, I need to map these into the required JSON structure, focusing on each action with subject, object, n_characters, type (tension or emotional link), and subtype (friendship, love).

I should ensure each action is as simple as possible without character names, using snake_case. For example, "mother_duck_sits_on_nest" would be an action where the subject is mother duck and object is herself.

Let me list out the actions in order:

1. Mother sits on nest.
   - Type: emotional_link (love), subtype: love
2. Large egg hatches.
   - Tension: health_at_risk
3. Mother takes brood to water.
   - Emotional link: friendship/love
4. Ducklings mock ugly one, bite him.
   - Tension: life_at_risk, health_at_risk
5. Mother defends duckling.
   - Emotional link: love
6. Duckling runs away from farmyard.
   - Emotional link: none, but tension from rejection
7. Wild ducks mock him.
   - Emotional link: none (rejection)
8. Sportsmen shoot at ducks, dog chases.
   - Tension: life_at_risk, health_at_risk
9. Duckling escapes to cottage.
   - Action: seeks shelter, no emotional link yet
10. Hen and cat reject him.
    - Emotional link: none (rejection)
11. Duckling leaves cottage.
12. Faces harsh winter, ice forms.
    - Tension: life_at_risk
13. Peasant rescues duckling.
    - Emotional link: love/kindness
14. Children frighten him.
    - Tension: health_at_risk (stress)
15. Spring arrives, he sees swans.
16. Sees reflection, realizes he's a swan.
    - Emotional link: self-acceptance (love subtype)
17. Swans welcome him.
    - Emotional link: friendship
18. Children feed and accept him.
    - Emotional link: friendship

Wait, I need to structure each action as per the instructions. Each JSON object should have "action", "n_characters", "subject", "object". For example:

{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "mother_duck_sits_on_nest",
      "n_characters": 1,
      "subject": "mother_duck",
      "object": "-",
      "type": "emotional_link",
      "subtype": "love"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

I think I have a good list of actions now. Each action should be a separate object in the JSON array, ordered chronologically.

Here is the structured JSON output based on the analysis:
