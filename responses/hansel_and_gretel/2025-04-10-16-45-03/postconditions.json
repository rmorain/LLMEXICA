Okay, so I need to figure out how to identify postconditions for each action in the story. Postconditions are changes in emotional links or tensions that result from an action. At least one postcondition is required for each action, and if there were preconditions, they can't be the same as the postconditions.

First, let's recall what we've done so far: We have a list of actions with their subjects, objects, and preconditions related to emotional links and tensions.

Now, I need to look at each action and determine how it affects the characters' emotions or the existing tensions. For example, if an action resolves a tension like `life_at_risk`, then a postcondition might be `life_normal`.

Let's start with the first action:

1. **man_expresses_anxiety_to_wife**: The father expresses anxiety about feeding the children. This likely increases the tension of `life_at_risk` because it highlights their dire situation.

2. **woman_proposes_abandoning_children**: The stepmother suggests abandoning them, which worsens the `life_at_risk` tension and creates a negative emotional link from her to the children.

3. **children_overhear_stepmothers_plan**: Hearing this plan would increase the children's fear, intensifying their anxiety and the `life_at_risk` tension.

4. **brotherComforts_sister**: Hansel comforting Gretel strengthens their bond, creating a positive emotional link of friendship or love between them.

5. **boy_prepares_escape_plan**: Hansel prepares to leave pebbles, which is an action to mitigate the risk, so this might start resolving the `life_at_risk` tension.

6. **family_enters_forest**: Entering the forest puts them in a dangerous situation, increasing the `life_at_risk` tension.

7. **father_abandons_children**: This action leaves Hansel and Gretel alone in the forest, heightening their life risk and creating emotional distress.

8. **boy_leaves_trail**: By leaving pebbles, Hansel ensures they can find their way back, which helps resolve the `life_at_risk` tension.

9. **children_find_way_home**: Finding their way home fully resolves the `life_at_risk` tension as they return safely.

10. **father_reunites_with_children**: Reuniting with his children restores emotional bonds and completely normalizes tensions related to life risk.

I need to ensure that each action's postconditions reflect these changes, especially focusing on resolving tensions where applicable.

Here's the JSON output with identified postconditions for each action:
