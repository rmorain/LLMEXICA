Okay, so I've got this story about Hansel and Gretel, and I need to analyze it for specific actions related to emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like someone being dead or in prison). The goal is to extract these actions into a JSON format with each action having subject, object, and the number of characters involved.

First, I'll read through the story again to identify key points. The family is struggling with poverty, leading the stepmother to suggest abandoning the kids. The father is against it but eventually agrees due to the pressure. This creates tension as the children's lives are at risk.

Hansel and Gretel overhear this plan. Their reaction shows their emotional bondâ€”Gretel cries, Hansel comforts her. That's a friendship link. He plans to leave pebbles to find their way back, which is an action showing resourcefulness but not directly an emotional link or tension.

The stepmother takes them into the forest, leaves them there. They use the pebbles to return home, so no immediate tension here except the initial abandonment.

Next time they're taken deeper into the forest. Hansel tries to leave crumbs, but birds eat them. This creates a life-at-risk situation because they can't find their way back. They get lost, which is another tension point (life_at_risk). They come across a witch's house made of bread and cakes, leading them into more danger.

The witch imprisons Hansel to eat him later, and forces Gretel to work. This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Gretel eventually outsmarts the witch by pushing her into the oven, which resolves some tension but adds another as she kills the witch (character_dead).

After escaping, they find a duck that helps them cross water, more of an action than an emotional link. Finally, they return home to their father, who is happy to see them, indicating reconciliation and love.

I need to list all actions where characters are involved in emotional links or tensions. Each entry should have subject, object, n_characters, and type (either emotional_link or tension). Emotional links are friendship or love; tensions include character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner.

So, I'll go through each part step by step:

1. Stepmother suggests abandoning the children: This is a tension because their lives are at risk.
2. Father agrees reluctantly: Another tension as he's going along with it, risking their lives.
3. Hansel comforts Gretel: Friendship emotional link.
4. They get lost in the forest: Life at risk.
5. Witch imprisons Hansel: Prisoner tension.
6. Gretel kills the witch: Character dead.
7. Children return home safely: Love from father.

I need to make sure each action is as general as possible without character names and in snake_case, with n_characters accurate based on subject and object presence. Actions like "stepmother_suggests_abandoning_children" fit because they involve the stepmother (subject) and children (object), so 2 characters.
