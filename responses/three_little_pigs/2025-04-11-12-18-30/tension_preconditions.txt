Alright, so I need to go through each action in "The Three Little Pigs" story and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. The user has already provided a list of actions with some emotional links as preconditions, and now they want me to add tensions.

First, let's recall what tensions are: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. These are situations that create suspense or conflict in the story. For each action, I need to determine if there’s a tension that must exist for the action to make sense.

Let me go through each action one by one and think about what tensions might be necessary as preconditions.

1. **send_out_into_world**: The mother sends her sons out because she can’t feed them. There's no immediate danger or tension here; it’s more of a setup. So, no tension precondition.

2. **build_house_with_straw**: The first pig builds a weak house. No direct tension here; it’s about his laziness setting up future problems.

3. **build_house_with_sticks**: Similar to the above, the second pig’s house isn’t sturdy but doesn’t introduce immediate tension.

4. **sing_and_dance_together**: The pigs are enjoying themselves. This is a peaceful moment, so no tensions here.

5. **build_house_with_bricks**: The third pig builds a strong house. No direct tension; it’s about preparedness.

6. **smell_pig_inside_house**: The wolf smells the first pig and decides to eat him. This introduces `life_at_risk` for the pig, so this action requires that the pig's life is at risk as a precondition.

7. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: The wolf tries to trick the pig into letting him in. This continues the tension from the previous action; the pig’s life remains at risk.

8. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: The pig refuses entry because he sees the wolf's paws. This is a response to the existing `life_at_risk` tension.

9. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf threatens to blow the house down after being refused. This escalates the tension; the pig’s life is still at risk, and now there's an added threat of losing shelter.

10. **blow_down_straw_house**: The wolf blows down the straw house. This action results from the previous threats and the existing `life_at_risk` tension for the pig.

11. **escape_and_hide**: The first pig escapes to the second pig’s house. This action is a response to the `life_at_risk` tension he just faced.

12. **smell_pigs_inside_house**: The wolf smells the pigs in the stick house, renewing the `life_at_risk` tension for them.

13. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: Similar to before, the wolf tries to trick the pigs into letting him in, maintaining the `life_at_risk` tension.

14. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: The pigs refuse entry again because they see the wolf’s ears, responding to the ongoing `life_at_risk` tension.

15. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf threatens again after being refused, escalating the tension further with the pigs’ lives at risk.

16. **blow_down_stick_house**: The wolf blows down the stick house, which is a direct result of the previous threats and the ongoing `life_at_risk` tension for the pigs.

17. **escape_and_hide_together**: The two pigs escape to the brick house together, driven by the `life_at_risk` tension they’re under.

18. **chase_pigs_down_lane**: The wolf chases them, which is a direct result of the existing `life_at_risk` tension for the pigs.

19. **slam_door_before_wolf_enters**: The pigs slam the door shut to keep the wolf out, responding to the immediate `life_at_risk` tension.

20. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: The wolf tries again to trick them into letting him in, maintaining the `life_at_risk` tension for the pigs.

21. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: The pigs refuse entry once more because they see the wolf’s eyes, continuing under the `life_at_risk` tension.

22. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: Another threat from the wolf after being refused, keeping the `life_at_risk` tension high.

23. **huff_and_puff_but_fail_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf tries but fails to blow down the brick house. This action occurs under the existing `life_at_risk` tension for the pigs.

24. **climb_on_roof_to_enter_through_chimney**: The wolf decides to enter through the chimney, which introduces a new `prisoner` tension as he’s trying to infiltrate their safe space.

25. **make_blazing_fire_and_boil_water**: The third pig prepares a trap for the wolf. This action is a response to the ongoing `life_at_risk` and `prisoner` tensions.

26. **fall_into_scalding_water**: The wolf falls into the boiling water, which results in his death, introducing a `character_dead` tension as a consequence of the previous actions.

Throughout this process, I noticed that most actions after the wolf appears are driven by the `life_at_risk` tension for the pigs. The later part introduces `prisoner` and finally `character_dead` tensions as the story progresses towards its climax.
