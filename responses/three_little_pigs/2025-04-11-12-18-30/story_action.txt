Alright, let me break down how I approached analyzing this story to extract the necessary actions with emotional links and tensions.

First, I read through the entire story carefully to understand the plot and identify key events involving the main characters: the mother pig, the three little pigs, and the wolf. My goal was to focus on actions that relate to friendship or love between characters and those that build tension, specifically around character death, life at risk, health at risk, or imprisonment.

Starting with the beginning of the story, the mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This action shows a parental care aspect but isn't directly about emotional links beyond that. So, I noted it as an action without specific emotional links.

Next, each little pig builds their respective houses. These actions are more about their individual characteristics (lazy vs. hardworking) and set the stage for future tensions with the wolf. I didn't assign emotional links here since they don't directly involve relationships between characters.

When the wolf appears, he starts targeting each pig, which introduces tension related to life being at risk. The first encounter involves the wolf trying to eat the first little pig, who escapes. This is a clear case of life_at_risk and also shows the friendship between the first and second pigs as they hide together. I made sure to note the emotional link here.

Moving on, the wolf blows down the second house, leading the two pigs to escape to the third's brick house. Again, this action involves life_at_risk for both pigs and reinforces their friendship as they seek safety together.

At the brick house, all three pigs are in danger, increasing the tension. The wolf's repeated attempts to blow the house down keep the life_at_risk tension high. Their cooperation to fend off the wolf showcases their strong bond of friendship.

Finally, the third pig outsmarts the wolf by boiling him alive. This action resolves the tension but also introduces a character_dead situation as the wolf is killed. While this doesn't directly involve emotional links between pigs, it's a significant action in the story.

Throughout my analysis, I made sure each action was concise and could be generalized for other stories, avoiding specific names and keeping them in snake_case. I also ensured that each JSON object correctly reflected the number of characters involved, whether they were subjects or objects, and only included relevant keys as per instructions.
