Okay, so I need to help identify the preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story of "The Three Little Pigs." The user wants me to go through each action listed in the previous JSON and add a `preconditions` key that includes any emotional links required for that action. Emotional links can be either `friendship` or `love`, and they have magnitudes from -3 to 3.

First, I should recall what preconditions are. They're like the requirements that need to be met before an action can happen. In this case, those preconditions involve emotional links between characters. So, for each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that makes sense as a precondition.

Let me go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary.

1. **send_out_into_world**: This is the mother pig sending her sons out because she can't feed them. So, here, the mother needs to have a positive emotional link towards her sons—probably `friendship` or `love`. Since it's a parent-child relationship, maybe `love` with a high magnitude like 3.

2. **build_house_with_straw**: The first little pig is lazy and builds a weak house. I don't see any direct emotional link here; he’s just being lazy. So, no preconditions related to emotional links.

3. **build_house_with_sticks**: Similar to the above, the second pig is somewhat lazy but works a bit harder. Again, no clear emotional link needed here.

4. **sing_and_dance_together**: The first and second pigs are having fun together. This implies a positive `friendship` bond between them. Maybe a magnitude of 2 since they enjoy each other's company.

5. **build_house_with_bricks**: The third pig works hard and builds a sturdy house. No direct emotional link here; it’s more about his character trait of being responsible.

6. **smell_pig_inside_house**: The wolf smells the first pig and wants to eat him. This action is driven by hunger or predator instinct, not an emotional link between characters. So, no preconditions related to emotional links.

7. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: The wolf tries to trick the pig into letting him in. There's no emotional link here; it’s more about deception.

8. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: The pig refuses to let the wolf in because he sees the big paws. This might be driven by fear or mistrust, which could imply a negative `friendship` magnitude like -2 from the pig towards the wolf.

9. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf threatens the pig after being refused. Again, driven by anger or hunger, not an emotional link.

10. **blow_down_straw_house**: The wolf successfully blows down the straw house. No direct emotional link here; it’s an action resulting from his earlier threat.

11. **escape_and_hide**: The first pig escapes and hides with the second pig. This shows trust and reliance between them, indicating a positive `friendship` magnitude of 2.

12. **smell_pigs_inside_house**: Similar to action 6, the wolf smells the pigs in the stick house. Driven by hunger, no emotional link needed.

13. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: The wolf tries to trick the second and third pigs. Again, deception rather than an emotional link.

14. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: Similar to action 8, the pigs refuse entry because they see the wolf’s pointy ears. This could indicate a negative `friendship` magnitude of -2 towards the wolf.

15. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf threatens again after being refused. Driven by anger or hunger, no emotional link.

16. **blow_down_stick_house**: The wolf blows down the stick house. No direct emotional link here.

17. **escape_and_hide_together**: The two pigs escape to the brick house together. This shows teamwork and trust, indicating a positive `friendship` magnitude of 2.

18. **chase_pigs_down_lane**: The wolf chases them. Driven by hunger or anger, no emotional link needed.

19. **slam_door_before_wolf_enters**: The pigs slam the door shut to keep the wolf out. This action is driven by fear and a need for safety, possibly indicating a negative `friendship` magnitude of -2 towards the wolf.

20. **knock_on_door_and_request_entry**: Again, the wolf tries to trick them into letting him in. No emotional link here.

21. **refuse_entry_through_keyhole**: The pigs refuse entry again because they see the wolf’s narrow eyes. This could imply a negative `friendship` magnitude of -2 towards the wolf.

22. **threaten_to_blow_down_house**: Another threat from the wolf after being refused. Driven by frustration, no emotional link needed.

23. **huff_and_puff_but_fail_to_blow_down_house**: The wolf tries but fails to blow down the brick house. No direct emotional link here.

24. **climb_on_roof_to_enter_through_chimney**: The wolf decides to enter through the chimney. Driven by hunger and persistence, no emotional link needed.

25. **make_blazing_fire_and_boil_water**: The third pig prepares a trap for the wolf. This shows cleverness and determination to protect himself and his brothers, indicating trust and teamwork—positive `friendship` magnitude of 2 among the pigs.

26. **fall_into_scalding_water**: The wolf falls into the boiling water. This is the result of the pig's trap, no direct emotional link needed.

I think I've covered all actions and identified where emotional links act as preconditions. Most of them involve either positive friendship bonds between the pigs or negative feelings towards the wolf.
