Okay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.

Looking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.

Tensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.

Now, I'll go through the story step by step.

1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.

2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.

3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.

4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.

5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.

Wait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.

Wait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.

Wait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.

But since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.

This might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.

So after the first house is blown down:

- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)
- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.

Then, wolf goes to second house:

- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)
- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?

Wait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.

So:

After first attack:
- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)
- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)

After second attack:
- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)
- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)

Then at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:

- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)
- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.

Finally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.

So let me list these actions in order:

1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.
2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.
3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.
4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.
5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.
6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
7. Wolf dies.

Wait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.

So the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.

Now, translating each into JSON:

Action 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house

Wait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had "blows down straw house" but maybe more general like "blow_down_house".

But the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps "blow_down_house".

Similarly, "seek_help", "trap_enemy", etc.

So Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.

Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.

Action 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.

Wait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?

But that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.

I think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.

So I'll proceed similarly:

Action 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.
Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.
Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.
Action 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.

Wait, the action is "seek_help". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.

So:

Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)
Then both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:

Action 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig
Action 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig

But that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.

Hmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.

So:

Action 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.
Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.
Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.
Action 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.
Action 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.

Then:

Action 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.

Wait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.

So Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.

Then:

Action 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.

Finally:

Action 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.

Wait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action "trap_enemy" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.

So putting it all together:

1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig
2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig
3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig
4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig
5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig
6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig
7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf

Wait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.

So actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.

Alternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.

So the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.
