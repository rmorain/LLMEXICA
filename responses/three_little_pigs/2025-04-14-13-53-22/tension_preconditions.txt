Alright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and preconditions for emotional links. My task is to add another key under `preconditions` called `tensions`, which will include any relevant tension types that must exist before the action can occur.

First, let me recall what tensions are defined as: they include `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. These are states that create tension in the narrative.

Now, I'll go through each action to determine if any tensions must be present for the action to make sense.

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.
   - The wolf is trying to eat the pig, so this creates a `life_at_risk` tension for the first pig. So, a precondition of `life_at_risk` from 'a' (wolf) to 'b' (first_pig).

2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.
   - The first pig is fleeing because his life is at risk after the wolf blew down his house. So, there's an existing tension of `life_at_risk` affecting him.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.
   - Similar to the first action, this puts the second pig's life at risk.

4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Again, the first pig is in a situation where his life is still at risk, prompting him to seek help.

5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - The second pig's life is now at risk after their house was destroyed.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.
   - At this point, all three pigs are in the brick house, and the wolf is trying to get to them, putting their lives at risk.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
   - This action is a response to the ongoing tension where the wolf poses a threat to the pigs' lives.

So, for each action, I need to identify if there's an existing tension that serves as a precondition for the action to occur.

Let me map this out:

1. **blow_down_house** (wolf → first_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to first_pig

2. **seek_help** (first_pig → second_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig

3. **blow_down_house** (wolf → second_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to second_pig

4. **seek_help** (first_pig → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig

5. **seek_help** (second_pig → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting second_pig

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney** (wolf → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to all pigs

7. **trap_enemy** (third_pig → wolf)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting all pigs, prompting defensive action

Now, I'll incorporate these tensions into the JSON structure under `preconditions` for each action.
