Alright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and the action itself. My task is to go through each action and identify any emotional links that are preconditions for those actions.

First, let me recall what an emotional link precondition means here: it's an existing relationship between characters (either friendship or love) that must be present for a specific action to make sense. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or love.

Looking at the actions:

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.
   - What emotional link would cause the wolf to attack? Probably hunger or predatory instincts, not an emotional link as defined (friendship or love). So no precondition here.

2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.
   - This action implies that the first pig trusts or likes the second pig enough to ask for help. So a friendship link with a positive magnitude makes sense. Let's say magnitude 2, indicating trust and reliance.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.
   - Similar to the first attack, this is driven by hunger, not an emotional link between wolf and pig. No precondition needed.

4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Again, seeking help implies trust or friendship. So another positive magnitude for friendship, maybe 2.

5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Same reasoning; the second pig trusts the third, so a positive friendship link with magnitude 2.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.
   - Driven by hunger or desire to eat them, not an emotional link. No precondition.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
   - The third pig's action is defensive, likely motivated by fear or self-preservation. However, if we consider the pigs' friendship, they might be protecting each other, so a positive friendship link (maybe magnitude 3 for strong bond) among the pigs could be a precondition enabling them to work together.

Now, I'll go through each action and add the preconditions as inferred.

For actions 2, 4, and 5, there are clear friendships that enable seeking help. For action 7, it's more about their collective safety, so a strong friendship bond makes sense.
