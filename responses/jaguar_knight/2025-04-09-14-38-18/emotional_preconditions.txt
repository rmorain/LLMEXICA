Alright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. The idea is that for certain actions to make sense, characters must have specific emotional links towards each other beforehand.

First, I'll list out all the actions:

1. bridge_collapses
2. character_injured
3. character_healed
4. character_kidnapped
5. character_tied_up
6. character_prays
7. character_searched_for
8. character_attacked
9. dust_thrown_in_face
10. character_stabbed
11. heart_taken_as_offer
12. character_freed
13. characters_kiss
14. tattoo_recognized
15. character_feels_ambivalence
16. character_jugular_cut
17. character_throat_cut

Now, I'll go through each action one by one and determine if there are any emotional links that must exist as preconditions for the action to make sense.

1. **bridge_collapses**: This is an event that happens due to external circumstances (the storm), so no emotional link is required here.

2. **character_injured**: Similar to the bridge collapsing, this is a result of the accident, not dependent on any emotional state.

3. **character_healed (PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: For PRINCESS to heal JAGUAR_KNIGHT, it's reasonable to assume that she must have a positive emotional link towards him, likely friendship or love. Given the context, maybe a moderate positive magnitude like 2.

4. **character_kidnapped (ENEMY kidnapped PRINCESS)**: For ENEMY to kidnap PRINCESS, there might be some negative emotion, possibly hatred towards her. So a negative emotional link from ENEMY to PRINCESS with magnitude -3.

5. **character_tied_up (ENEMY tied_up PRINCESS)**: This follows the kidnapping, so similar negative emotions as above apply.

6. **character_prays (JAGUAR_KNIGHT prayed)**: Praying might be driven by concern or care for someone else, suggesting a positive emotional link towards that person.

7. **character_searched_for (JAGUAR_KNIGHT searched_for ENEMY)**: Searching for someone could stem from various emotions, but in this context, it's likely due to the desire to rescue PRINCESS, indicating a positive link towards her and possibly negative towards ENEMY.

8. **character_attacked (JAGUAR_KNIGHT attacked ENEMY)**: Attacking usually involves some negative emotion like anger or hatred towards the target.

9. **dust_thrown_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT threw_dust_in_face ENEMY)**: Similar to attacking, this action would be driven by negative emotions towards ENEMY.

10. **character_stabbed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT stabbed ENEMY)**: Stabbing is a violent act and definitely involves strong negative emotions like hatred.

11. **heart_taken_as_offer (JAGUAR_KNIGHT took_heart_from ENEMY)**: Taking someone's heart as an offering suggests deep-seated anger or revenge, indicating a very negative emotional link.

12. **character_freed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT freed PRINCESS)**: Freeing someone typically involves positive emotions like care or love towards them.

13. **characters_kiss (PRINCESS kissed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Kissing is a clear sign of romantic love, so a strong positive emotional link here.

14. **tattoo_recognized (PRINCESS recognized_tattoo)**: Recognizing a tattoo linked to past trauma might evoke fear or hatred towards the person with the tattoo.

15. **character_feels_ambivalence (PRINCESS felt_ambivalence)**: Ambivalence implies conflicting emotions, possibly love and hatred, indicating both positive and negative links.

16. **character_jugular_cut (PRINCESS cut_jugular JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Cutting someone's jugular is an extreme act of violence, suggesting intense negative emotions like hatred or betrayal.

17. **character_throat_cut (PRINCESS cut_throat)**: Cutting one's own throat indicates profound emotional distress or despair, possibly stemming from complex emotional states towards oneself or others.

For each action where I identified emotional links, I'll structure the preconditions accordingly. For actions without clear emotional prerequisites, I'll leave the `emotional_links` array empty.
