Alright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the specified DPS format. First, I'll recall the structure of the DPS example given. It starts with 'Sto' followed by a number, then lists actors and actions.

Looking at the JSON, each action is between characters or involves one character. I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.

I notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.

I'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax. For actions without subjects or objects, I'll represent them with just the action name. Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.

I should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all. Finally, I'll compile all these into the DPS structure under the <DPS> tags.

Here is the converted JSON object to the Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) format:
