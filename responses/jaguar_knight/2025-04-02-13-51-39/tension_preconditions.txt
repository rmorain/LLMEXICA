Alright, so I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the given story. Each precondition is a tension that must exist for an action to make sense.

Starting with "storm-causes-damage": This action leads to the bridge collapsing, which puts Jaguar_Knight's life at risk. So, a `life_at_risk` tension arises from the storm (no specific character) affecting Jaguar_Knight.

Next, "character_gets_injured Jaguar_Knight": Jaguar_Knight is injured, so his health is at risk. This sets up a `health_at_risk` tension for him.

"Princess provides_medical_aid Jaguar_Knight": Princess helps because Jaguar_Knight's life was at risk. The precondition here is the existing `life_at_risk` tension.

"Jaguar_Knight recognizes_emotional_link": He realizes Princess saved his life, which connects to her action, but no direct tension here.

"Enemy kidnaps_princess Princess": This introduces a `prisoner` tension as she's captured. The enemy's motivation might be revenge, so perhaps a `clashing_emotions` since Princess is angry and scared.

"Jaguar_Knight prepares_for_rescue": He acts because Princess is in danger (`prisoner`), so the existing tension is her captivity.

"Princess confronts_enemy Enemy": She confronts her captor due to being a prisoner, so `prisoner` tension is key here.

"Jaguar_Knight fights_enemy Enemy": He fights to rescue Princess, driven by her `prisoner` status and his emotional links.

"Princess discovers_tattoo": This revelation introduces `clashing_emotions` in her towards Jaguar_Knight due to conflicting feelings.

"Princess experiences_conflicting_emotions": Her internal conflict is a result of the tattoo discovery, leading to `clashing_emotions`.

"Princess kills_jaguar_knight Jaguar_Knight": Her action results in his death, introducing a `character_dead` tension for him.

"Princess commits_suicide": Her suicide adds another `character_dead` tension for herself.

Now, I need to map these tensions into the JSON structure, considering each action's context and the type of tension involved.
