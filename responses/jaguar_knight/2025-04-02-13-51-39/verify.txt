Alright, so I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by checking that `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. Also, after a character dies, they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions.

Starting with "storm-causes-damage": No characters involved, so no issues here.

"character_gets_injured Jaguar_Knight": Only Jaguar_Knight is involved, so `n_characters` is 1. Preconditions and postconditions correctly reference only him.

"Princess provides_medical_aid Jaguar_Knight": Both Princess and Jaguar_Knight are involved. The preconditions have a positive emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight, which makes sense as she helps him. Postconditions resolve the `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions and strengthen her positive link towards him.

"Jaguar_Knight recognizes_emotional_link": Only Jaguar_Knight is involved. His recognition leads to a positive emotional link towards Princess, logically consistent.

"Enemy kidnaps_princess Princess": Both Enemy and Princess are involved. The action introduces `prisoner` tension for Princess and negative emotions from her towards the Enemy.

"Jaguar_Knight prepares_for_rescue": Only Jaguar_Knight is involved. His preparation is driven by his positive feelings towards Princess, consistent with the previous actions.

"Princess confronts_enemy Enemy": Both are involved. Her confrontation reflects her negative emotions towards the Enemy, consistent with being a prisoner.

"Jaguar_knight_fights_enemy Enemy": Both are involved. The fight resolves the `prisoner` tension for Princess and shows Jaguar_Knight's bravery, affecting emotional links positively towards Princess.

"Princess discovers_tattoo": Only Princess is involved. This discovery introduces `clashing_emotions` as she feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.

"Character_experiences_conflicting_emotions": Only Princess is involved. Her internal conflict leads to negative emotions towards Jaguar_Knight, consistent with her earlier discovery.

"Princess kills_jaguar_knight Jaguar_Knight": Both are involved. This action results in Jaguar_Knight's death and introduces a `character_dead` tension for him. It also creates a strong negative emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight.

"Character_commits_suicide": Only Princess is involved. After killing Jaguar_Knight, she takes her own life, resulting in her own death and a `character_dead` tension.

I need to ensure that after a character dies, no further emotional links or tensions are assigned to them. For example, after Jaguar_Knight's death, he shouldn't be part of any subsequent emotional links or tensions.

Also, ensuring that `a` refers to the subject and `b` to the object in all cases, avoiding any mismatches.
