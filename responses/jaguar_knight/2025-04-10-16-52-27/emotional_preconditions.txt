Alright, I'm trying to understand how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story. So, first, I need to go through each action and figure out if there's an emotional link that must exist before the character can perform that action.

Let me start with the first action: "bridge_collapse". This seems like an event caused by the storm, so it doesn't involve any characters directly. Therefore, there are no emotional links here. The preconditions should be empty.

Next is "princess_heals_jaguar". For Princess to heal Jaguar, she must have some positive emotional link towards him. Since they develop romantic feelings later, I think a 'love' type with a magnitude of 2 makes sense here. So, Princess (a) has love of magnitude 2 towards Jaguar (b).

Moving on to "enemy_kidnaps_princess". The enemy kidnaps Princess because he wants revenge. This implies some negative emotions towards her or her family. I think 'love' with a negative magnitude might not fit; perhaps 'friendship' with a negative magnitude? Or maybe it's hatred, so 'friendship' type with magnitude -3 from enemy (a) to Princess (b).

Then we have "jaguar_decides_to_rescue_princess". Jaguar decides to rescue her because he cares about her. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely 'love', with a high magnitude like 3.

In "princess_confronts_enemy", Princess confronts the enemy out of anger or fear for her life. This could be driven by negative emotions towards the enemy. Maybe 'friendship' type with magnitude -2 from Princess (a) to Enemy (b).

"Enemy_attacks_princess" is an action where the enemy attacks Princess, indicating a strong negative emotion. So, similar to before, maybe 'friendship' with magnitude -3 from Enemy (a) to Princess (b).

"Jaguar_searches_for_enemy" implies that Jaguar is motivated by his emotional link towards Princess. Again, likely 'love' with magnitude 3 from Jaguar (a) to Princess (b).

In "jaguar_kills_enemy", Jaguar's action is driven by anger or a desire to protect Princess. This suggests a strong negative emotion towards the enemy, so 'friendship' type with magnitude -3 from Jaguar (a) to Enemy (b).

"Princess_liberated_by_jaguar" is a result of Jaguar's successful rescue, so it's more about the action than an emotional link precondition.

"Jaguar_admires_princess_bravery" indicates that Jaguar holds Princess in high regard. This would be a positive 'love' type with magnitude 3 from Jaguar (a) to Princess (b).

"Princess_kisses_jaguar" is a clear expression of romantic feelings, so 'love' type with magnitude 3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar (b).

"Princess_recognizes_tattoo" leads her to feel conflicted. This recognition doesn't necessarily require an emotional link precondition but is more about knowledge.

Finally, "princess_kills_jaguar" and "princess_commits_suicide". These actions are driven by a mix of anger and sorrow towards Jaguar. So, perhaps 'love' with magnitude -3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar (b).

I think I've covered each action and inferred the necessary emotional links as preconditions.
