Alright, so I need to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story. Tensions include things like a character being at risk of death, their life or health being in danger, or being held prisoner.

Let me go through each action one by one and think about what tension must exist for that action to happen.

1. **bridge_collapse**: This is an event caused by the storm damaging the bridge. Since no specific characters are involved here, there's no direct tension related to a character. So, tensions precondition is empty.

2. **princess_heals_jaguar**: For Princess to heal Jaguar, he must be injured, which implies his health is at risk. So, the precondition is that Jaguar's health is in danger.

3. **enemy_kidnaps_princess**: This action puts Princess in a prisoner situation. Therefore, the precondition is that she is now a prisoner.

4. **jaguar_decides_to_rescue_princess**: Jaguar decides to rescue her because she is in captivity (prisoner). So, the tension here is that Princess is being held prisoner.

5. **princess_confronts_enemy**: Confronting the enemy suggests that Princess's life might be at risk since the enemy is hostile. So, her life is in danger.

6. **enemy_attacks_princess**: The enemy attacking her directly endangers her life. Thus, the tension is life_at_risk for Princess.

7. **jaguar_searches_for_enemy**: Jaguar is searching because he wants to rescue Princess from captivity. So, the tension here is that she is a prisoner.

8. **jaguar_kills_enemy**: This action leads to the enemy's death, so the precondition is that the enemy is in a situation where their life is at risk due to Jaguar's actions.

9. **princess_liberated_by_jaguar**: After being rescued, Princess is no longer a prisoner, but the liberation itself doesn't require a tension precondition beyond her previous state of captivity.

10. **jaguar_admires_princess_bravery**: This action doesn't inherently involve a tension; it's more about emotional links. So, tensions are empty here.

11. **princess_kisses_jaguar**: Again, this is an expression of emotion without inherent tension. No specific tension precondition needed.

12. **princess_recognizes_tattoo**: Recognition leads to conflict but doesn't directly tie to a tension; it's more about knowledge or emotional state.

13. **princess_kills_jaguar**: This action results in Jaguar's death, so the precondition is that his life is at risk leading up to this moment.

14. **princess_commits_suicide**: After killing Jaguar, Princess takes her own life, implying her life was at risk due to her actions or emotional state.

I think I've covered all the necessary points for each action, determining which tensions must exist as preconditions.

This JSON structure includes preconditions related to tensions, indicating the type of tension and the characters involved. Each precondition ensures that the necessary tension exists for the action to occur.
