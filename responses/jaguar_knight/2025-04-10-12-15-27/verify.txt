Okay, I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying that each action's n_characters aligns with its preconditions and postconditions. Also, after a character dies, they shouldn't have further emotional links or tensions.

Starting from the beginning:

1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No emotional links, only tension `health_at_risk`.
   - Consistent because no character IDs are referenced.

2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Preconditions include `emotional_links` from a to b.
   - Postconditions have both emotional links and tensions resolved (`health_normal`).
   - Emotional links from b to a in postconditions, which is okay as it's a different direction.

3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No preconditions; postconditions add an emotional link of friendship from a.
   - Since only one character, using 'a' is correct.

4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Preconditions and postconditions correctly reference both characters as prisoner and life_at_risk.

5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No preconditions or postconditions related to emotional links, only seeking help.

6. **Enemy attacks Princess**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Postconditions add a negative emotional link from b to a and life_at_risk tension.
   - Consistent with the action's effect.

7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - Emotional links from a, consistent as only one character involved.

8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Postconditions resolve prisoner and life_at_risk tensions with normal tensions.
   - Emotional link from a to b remains positive.

9. **Princess feels conflicted**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - Introduces clashing_emotions tension without affecting emotional links.

10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**:
    - After this, both characters die, so no further actions should involve them.
    - Postconditions reflect character_dead tension and negative emotional link from a to b.

11. **Princess commits suicide**:
    - `n_characters` is 1.
    - Results in her death, adding another character_dead tension.

I need to ensure that once a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. Also, verify that 'a' refers to the subject and 'b' to the object consistently across all actions.
