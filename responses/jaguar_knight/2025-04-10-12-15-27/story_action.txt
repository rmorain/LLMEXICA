Okay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.

Now, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.

Starting from the beginning:

1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.
2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).
3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.
4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.
5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.
6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking herâ€”another life_at_risk moment.
7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.
8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.
9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.

I need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.

Each action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.

Now, organizing them:

1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).
2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).
3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).
4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).
5. Jaguar prays for help (n_characters=1, subject only).
6. Enemy attacks Princess (life_at_risk).
7. Jaguar searches and fights enemy (life_at_risk, prisoner resolved).
8. Princess has mixed emotions (clashing_emotions).
9. Princess kills Jaguar (character_dead).
10. Princess dies (character_dead).

I think that covers all the key points without missing any tensions or emotional links.
