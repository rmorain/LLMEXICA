Alright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the Primitive Action Description (PAD) language as per the user's instructions. The PAD syntax requires specifying each action with preconditions and postconditions in a specific format.

First, I'll review the PAD syntax:

- Each action starts with 'ACT' followed by the action name and number of characters.
- Preconditions are optional and listed under 'PRE'.
- Postconditions are mandatory and include both emotional links and tensions after 'POS'.

I need to ensure that each JSON object is accurately translated into PAD, maintaining the correct format for emotional links and tensions. Emotional links have a type (1 for friendship, 2 for love) and magnitude (with + or - signs). Tensions use specific codes like 'Lr' for life_at_risk.

Let's start with the first action:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters, so no preconditions or postconditions.
2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, health_at_risk applies.
3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight, resolving health_at_risk and strengthening friendship.

I'll structure each action in PAD accordingly, ensuring proper spacing and syntax. For actions without preconditions, I'll omit the 'PRE' section. Postconditions must always be present.

Now, I'll convert each JSON object into PAD format.
