Alright, I need to convert the given JSON into the DPS format as per the user's request. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

The JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.

First, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.

So, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be "Subject Action Object". If either is missing, I omit it.

Let me go through each action one by one:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.
2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.
3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.
6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.
7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.
8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.
13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.
14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.
16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.
17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.

I notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.

Wait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.

Now, for each action line:

- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as "Subject Action Object".
- If only one is present, just include that part.
- If neither is present, just the action.

Let me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is "storm_damage_bridge", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.

I'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.
