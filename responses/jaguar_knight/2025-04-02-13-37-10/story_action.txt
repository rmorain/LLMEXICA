Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.

Looking through the story step by step:

1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.

2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.

3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.

4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.

5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.

6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.

7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).

8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.

9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.

10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).

11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.

12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.

13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).

14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.

15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.

16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.

17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).

18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.

So, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.

I'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.
