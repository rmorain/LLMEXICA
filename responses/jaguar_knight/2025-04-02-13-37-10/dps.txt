Okay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.

The user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.

Alright, looking at the example, it starts with "Sto ;1" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like "Eagle_Knight Actor", "Jaguar_Knight Actor", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format "<Subject> <Action> <Object>".

So, my approach should be:

1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.
2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.

I need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON. Also, I should avoid adding extra information not present in the JSON.

Let me start by identifying all characters from the JSON:

- Tlaloc
- Jaguar_Knight
- Princess
- Enemy
- Quetzalcoatl
- Huitzilopochtli
- Tonatiuh

Next, I'll go through each action and convert it accordingly. For example, the first action is "Tlaloc Sends Storm". In DPS, this would be "Tlaloc Sends_Storm".

I need to ensure that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly. If an action has both subject and object, like "Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds", it should follow the "<Subject> <Action> <Object>" format.

Also, I have to make sure that all characters are listed as actors at the beginning of the DPS.

Alright, putting this together, I'll start with the header, list all characters, and then sequentially add each action based on the JSON.
