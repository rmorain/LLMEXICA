Alright, I'm trying to help this user by analyzing the story they provided. They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.

First, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').

Starting with "suffers_injury": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).

Next, "applies_curative_plant" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.

"Kidnaps" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, "ties_to_rock" continues this prisoner situation.

"Prays" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.

"Searches_for_enemy" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner. So, the tension here is prisoner related.

"Throws_dust", "attacks_with_dagger", and "takes_heart" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions are taken under life_at_risk for both characters involved.

"Liberates_prisoner" addresses the prisoner tension by freeing Princess.

"Kisses" doesn't have a direct tension precondition but follows from resolved tensions, so no specific tension here.

"Recognizes_tattoo" leads to new tensions as Princess's emotions shift, indicating her life might be at risk due to her actions.

"Cuts_jugular" and "cuts_throat" result in character_dead for both Jaguar_Knight and Princess, respectively.

I need to ensure each tension is correctly identified and mapped to the appropriate characters. If a tension involves no specific character or applies generally, I'll use '*' or '-' as needed.
