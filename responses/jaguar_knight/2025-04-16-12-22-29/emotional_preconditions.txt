Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.

First, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.

Let me start with the first action: "suffers_injury". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.

Next, "applies_curative_plant" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.

Moving on to "kidnaps", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.

"Ties_to_rock" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.

"Prays" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.

"Searches_for_enemy" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.

"Throws_dust", "attacks_with_dagger", and "takes_heart" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.

"Liberates_prisoner" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.

"Kisses" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.

"Recognizes_tattoo" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.

"Cuts_jugular" and "cuts_throat" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.

I need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved. Also, I should format everything correctly in JSON with the specified keys.
