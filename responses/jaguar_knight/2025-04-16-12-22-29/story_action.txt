Alright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.

I need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.

Let me start by breaking down the story step by step. 

1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.

2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.

3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.

4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.

5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.

6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.

7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.

8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.

9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.

10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.

11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.

12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.

13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.

14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.

I need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.

Wait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.

I should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.

Now, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.
