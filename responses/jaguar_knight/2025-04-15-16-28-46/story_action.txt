Alright, I'm trying to understand how to approach this problem. The user provided a story and asked for an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They also specified the format for the JSON output.

First, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the focus is on actions between characters, maybe some gods can be excluded as they're not directly interacting in a way that forms emotional links or tensions.

Looking at the story step by step:

1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. This sets up a life_at_risk tension.
2. Princess uses a curative plant to save him. This shows non-romantic affection as she's helping him survive. So, an action where she heals him.
3. Later, Enemy kidnaps Princess because of past humiliation. This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, leading to actions like searching and attacking the enemy.
4. After rescuing, Princess feels admiration, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, indicating a romantic emotional link.
5. Princess recognizes a tattoo linked to her father's murder, causing conflicting emotions: love vs. hatred. This is an internal conflict but also affects their emotional links.
6. She kills Jaguar_Knight and then herself, resulting in both characters_dead, which is a tension.

I need to extract each action, determine if it relates to emotional links or tensions, and structure them in JSON with subject, object, n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case without character names.

For example, when Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, the action is 'heals_wounds', subject is Princess, object is Jaguar_Knight, n_characters=2.

I also need to ensure that each action only includes characters as subjects or objects, avoiding inanimate objects. Each JSON entry should be chronological and accurate based on the story events.

```json

        "action": "heals_wounds",
        "n_characters": 2,
        "subject": "Princess",
        "object": "Jaguar_Knight"
    },
    {
        "action": "liberates",
        "n_characters": 2,
        "subject": "Jaguar_Knight",
        "object": "Princess"
    },
    {
        "action": "kisses",
        "n_characters": 2,
        "subject": "Princess",
        "object": "Jaguar_Knight"
    },
    {
        "action": "kills",
        "n_characters": 2,
        "subject": "Princess",
        "object": "Jaguar_Knight"
    },
    {
        "action": "kills_self",
        "n_characters": 1,
        "subject": "Princess",
        "object": "-"
    }
