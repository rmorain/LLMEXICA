Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a specific format to follow, which involves adding a "preconditions" key to each action, containing an array of emotional_links. Each emotional_link should specify the type, magnitude, and direction (from and to).

First, I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Action: heals_wounds**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   The princess heals Jaguar_Knight's wounds because she cares about him. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely non-romantic since it's before any romantic feelings develop.

2. **Action: liberates**
   - **Subject:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **Object:** Princess
   - **n_characters:** 2

   Jaguar_Knight rescues the princess because he cares about her safety and well-being, indicating a strong positive emotional link towards her.

3. **Action: kisses**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   The kiss indicates romantic feelings between them, so this should be categorized under the romantic type with a high magnitude.

4. **Action: kills**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   This action is driven by hatred or intense anger due to discovering the tattoo linked to her father's murder, so a negative non-romantic link with high magnitude.

5. **Action: kills_self**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** -
   - **n_characters:** 1

   This action is driven by internal emotional conflict and grief, but since it's self-directed, there are no direct emotional links to another character in this specific action.

Now, applying these insights:

- For each action, I'll determine if there's an emotional link precondition.
- Assign the type as either "non-romantic" or "romantic".
- Set magnitude based on the intensity of emotions inferred from the story context.
- Use 'a' and 'b' to indicate source (from) and target (to).

I need to ensure that if an action involves both subject and object, the emotional link directions are correctly set. If an action doesn't have a valid object or subject, I might need to adjust accordingly.

Finally, structure all this into the specified JSON format, adding the "preconditions" key with the identified emotional links for each action.
