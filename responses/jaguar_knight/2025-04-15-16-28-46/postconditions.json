Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in this story analysis. The user has provided specific instructions on what a postcondition entails and how it should be structured within the JSON output.

First, let's recall that postconditions are changes to emotional links or tensions caused by an action. They can either be new emotional links or resolved tensions (normal tensions). For each action, I need to determine:

1. **Emotional Links**: Did the action cause a change in how one character feels about another? If so, what type and magnitude?
2. **Tensions**: Did the action resolve any existing tensions?

I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Action: heals_wounds**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   The princess heals Jaguar_Knight's wounds, which likely strengthens a positive emotional link (non-romantic) from Jaguar_Knight to Princess. Additionally, healing resolves the health risk tension.

2. **Action: liberates**
   - **Subject:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **Object:** Princess
   - **n_characters:** 2

   Liberating the princess strengthens a positive emotional link (non-romantic) from Princess to Jaguar_Knight and resolves the prisoner tension.

3. **Action: kisses**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   The kiss indicates the development of romantic feelings, so a positive emotional link (romantic) is established from both characters towards each other.

4. **Action: kills**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** Jaguar_Knight
   - **n_characters:** 2

   This action results in Jaguar_Knight's death, which causes a negative emotional link (non-romantic) from Princess to Jaguar_Knight and introduces a new tension of character_dead.

5. **Action: kills_self**
   - **Subject:** Princess
   - **Object:** -
   - **n_characters:** 1

   The princess taking her own life results in her death, introducing the character_dead tension.

Now, applying these insights:

- For each action, I'll identify both emotional links and tensions that result from the action.
- Ensure that for emotional links, both subject and object are correctly set and n_characters is accurate.
- Use appropriate normal tensions to resolve preconditions where applicable.

Finally, structure all this into the specified JSON format, adding "postconditions" with "emotional_links" and "tensions" keys for each action.
