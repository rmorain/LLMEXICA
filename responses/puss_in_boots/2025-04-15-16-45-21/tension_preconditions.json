Alright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story. The user provided a list of actions with their respective subjects and objects, along with emotional link preconditions. Now, they want me to identify or infer tension preconditions.

First, I recall that tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. These are situations that create suspense or conflict in the narrative. A precondition here means that a particular tension must exist for an action to make sense.

I'll go through each action and think about what tensions might need to be present for that action to occur.

1. **Action: hears_despair**
   - Subject: Cat
   - Object: Marquis_of_Carabas
   - The master is despairing, which could imply his life or well-being is at risk if he doesn't get help. So maybe `life_at_risk` for the Marquis.

2. **Action: tricks_animal**
   - Subject: Cat
   - Object: -
   - This action is about tricking an animal, not directly related to any tension involving characters. No tension precondition needed here.

3. **Action: presents_gift**
   - Subject: Cat
   - Object: King
   - The Cat is trying to help his master avoid hunger, which could mean the Marquis's life is at risk if he fails. So `life_at_risk` for the Marquis.

4. **Action: tricks_animal**
   - Same as above; no tension needed since it’s about animals.

5. **Action: bathes_master**
   - Subject: Marquis_of_Carabas
   - Object: -
   - The master is bathing on the Cat's advice, which later leads to a situation where his life seems at risk (drowning). So `life_at_risk` for the Marquis.

6. **Action: cries_help**
   - Subject: Cat
   - Object: -
   - Crying for help implies that someone's life is at risk. Here, it’s the Marquis drowning, so `life_at_risk` for him.

7. **Action: receives_clothes**
   - Subject: King
   - Object: Marquis_of_Carabas
   - The King helps because the Marquis's clothes were stolen, which could imply he was in a risky situation. So `life_at_risk` or perhaps `health_at_risk`.

8. **Action: falls_in_love**
   - Subject: Princess
   - Object: Marquis_of_Carabas
   - This is about emotional links, not tensions, so no tension needed.

9. **Action: threatens_workers**
   - Subject: Cat
   - Object: -
   - The Cat threatens workers to maintain the illusion of the Marquis's wealth. No direct tension on characters, but maybe `life_at_risk` for the workers if they don’t comply.

10. **Action: transforms_mouse**
    - Subject: Ogre
    - Object: -
    - This is about the Ogre’s ability, not a tension involving another character.

11. **Action: eats_ogre**
    - Subject: Cat
    - Object: Ogre
    - The Ogre’s life is at risk as the Cat plans to eat him. So `life_at_risk` for the Ogre.

12. **Action: invites_castle**
    - Subject: King
    - Object: Marquis_of_Carabas
    - The King is impressed by the Marquis's supposed wealth, but no direct tension here.

13. **Action: marries_princess**
    - Subject: Marquis_of_Carabas
    - Object: Princess
    - This action resolves previous tensions and solidifies their union, so no specific tension needed.

Now, I'll map these thoughts into the JSON structure as per instructions, adding `tensions` under `preconditions` for each action where applicable.
