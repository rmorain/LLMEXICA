Alright, I need to analyze each action in the story to identify preconditions related to tensions. The user wants me to focus on specific tension types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, and prisoner.

Starting with "youngest_son_felt_sad": there's no direct tension here, so the array is empty.

"cat_promised_help_to_master": No immediate tension; it's about loyalty. Preconditions for tensions are empty.

"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat": Again, this action doesn't involve any tension as it's a supportive act.

"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag": This action is about providing food, no tension involved.

"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king": The cat wants to gain favor but there's no direct threat. No tensions here.

Similarly, "cat_caught_partridges_in_bag" and presenting them don't involve tension.

When the cat advises the master to wash in the river, it's a setup for future tension when the master is perceived as drowning. So, the action requires that the master's life is at risk (life_at_risk), with 'a' being the source and 'b' as the recipient.

The master washing in the river doesn't have its own tension precondition but leads to one in the next action.

"cat_cried_for_help": This directly relates to the previous setup, so the same life_at_risk applies here.

King sending guards is a response to the perceived drowning (life_at_risk). The source is 'a' (king), and recipient is 'b' (master).

Cat telling king clothes were stolen doesn't involve tension but sets up for the king providing clothes. No tensions here.

King giving new clothes also doesn't involve direct tension; it's a response to theft, not an immediate threat.

"princess_fell_in_love_with_master": This is an emotional link, no tension involved.

When the cat threatens mowers and reapers, there's an implied life_at_risk if they don't comply. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient is 'b' (mowers or reapers).

King asking about meadows and corn doesn't involve tension; it's informational.

Cat entering the ogre's castle introduces a potential threat from the ogre, so life_at_risk with 'a' as the cat and '*' indicating any character.

Ogre transforming into a lion creates direct life_at_risk for the cat. Source is 'b' (ogre), recipient 'a' (cat).

Cat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to the tension created by the ogre's transformation, so same as above.

Ogre transforming into a mouse doesn't involve tension; it's part of the trick.

Cat eating the mouse removes the tension. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient 'b' (mouse).

King visiting the castle doesn't involve tension but follows from earlier setup.

Finally, marquis marrying princess has no tension as it resolves the story positively.

I need to ensure that each action's tensions are correctly identified and linked to the appropriate characters. The magnitude of tension varies, with life_at_risk being most common here.
