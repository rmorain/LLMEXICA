Alright, so I need to analyze each action from the previous JSON output and identify any preconditions related to tensions. The tensions we're considering are: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. For each action, I have to determine if a tension precondition exists.

Starting with "mother_sends_daughter_to_visit_grandmother". The mother sends LRRH because the grandmother is ill. This implies that the grandmother's health is at risk, so a `health_at_risk` tension exists for her before this action happens.

Next, "little_red_riding_hood_meets_wolf_in_forest" doesn't inherently involve any tension precondition. It’s just an encounter, so no tensions here.

When the wolf asks LRRH about her grandmother, it implies that the wolf might pose a risk to either LRRH or her grandmother. So, there's a `life_at_risk` tension for both of them before this action.

LRRH telling the wolf about her grandmother increases the risk because now the wolf knows where she’s going and who she’s visiting. This puts both LRRH and her grandmother at `life_at_risk`.

The wolf running to the grandmother's house is driven by his intent to eat her, which means the grandmother's life is at risk. So, a `life_at_risk` tension exists for her.

Killing and eating the grandmother results in her death, so before this action, there’s an immediate `life_at_risk` tension leading up to her death, and afterward, she is dead (`character_dead`). But as a precondition, it's the risk that leads to the action.

LRRH gathering flowers and nuts doesn’t involve any inherent tensions; she’s just distracted. So no preconditions here.

The wolf disguising himself as the grandmother creates a deceptive situation where LRRH might be in danger when she arrives. This implies her life is at risk, so `life_at_risk` tension for her.

LRRH arriving at the house with the intent to visit her sick grandmother means the grandmother’s health is still at risk, so `health_at_risk` applies here as a precondition.

The wolf deceiving LRRH by pretending to be her grandmother puts LRRH's life at risk, so another `life_at_risk` tension exists for her before this action.

LRRH getting into bed with the wolf is risky because she’s unaware of the danger. This means her life is at risk during this action, indicating a `life_at_risk` precondition.

Finally, eating LRRH by the wolf obviously puts her life in immediate danger, so there's a `life_at_risk` tension for her before this fatal action occurs.

I need to make sure that each tension is correctly assigned based on the characters involved and the nature of the risk. The tensions are either about health risks or life being at risk, as these are the primary drivers of the narrative’s conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Mother Sends Daughter to Visit Grandmother:**
   - The grandmother's health is at risk, creating a `health_at_risk` tension before the action.

2. **Wolf Asks LRRH About Grandmother:**
   - The wolf's inquiry implies a potential threat, introducing a `life_at_risk` tension for both characters involved.

3. **LRRH Tells Wolf About Grandmother:**
   - Sharing information about the grandmother increases the risk to her life, maintaining the `life_at_risk` tension.

4. **Wolf Runs to Grandmother's House:**
   - The wolf’s intent to harm creates a `life_at_risk` tension for the grandmother.

5. **Wolf Kills and Eats Grandmother:**
   - Before the action, the grandmother is at risk of death, fulfilling the precondition with a `life_at_risk` tension.

6. **LRRH Arrives at Grandmother's House:**
   - The grandmother’s ongoing illness maintains a `health_at_risk` tension upon LRRH's arrival.

7. **Wolf Disguises as Grandmother:**
   - Deception by the wolf puts LRRH’s life at risk, introducing a `life_at_risk` tension for her.

8. **LRRH Gets Into Bed With Wolf:**
   - Unaware of the danger, LRRH is placed in a situation where her life is at risk, necessitating a `life_at_risk` precondition.

9. **Wolf Eats LRRH:**
   - The action is preceded by an immediate `life_at_risk` tension for LRRH, highlighting the peril she faces.
