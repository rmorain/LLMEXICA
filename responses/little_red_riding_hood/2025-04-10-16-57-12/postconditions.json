Alright, so I need to analyze each action and determine the postconditions, which are changes in emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. At least one postcondition is required for each action, and if there were preconditions, the postconditions can't be the same as those.

Starting with "mother_sends_daughter_to_visit_grandmother". This action likely strengthens LRRH's love for her mother and grandmother due to the caring gesture. So, positive emotional links of love from both LRRH to her mother and grandmother. No new tensions are introduced here since it's a positive action.

Next, "little_red_riding_hood_meets_wolf_in_forest" introduces a negative emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf as she might feel fear or distrust. This meeting also creates a `life_at_risk` tension for LRRH because of the potential danger posed by the wolf.

When the wolf asks LRRH about her grandmother, this increases the risk to both LRRH and her grandmother, so a `life_at_risk` tension is maintained or intensified. Additionally, LRRH might develop a negative emotional link towards the wolf due to the suspicious interaction.

LRRH telling the wolf about her grandmother could make her more trusting of the wolf initially, creating a positive friendship link, but this also increases the risk to her grandmother's life, maintaining the `life_at_risk` tension for her grandmother.

The wolf running to the grandmother's house leads to the grandmother's death, so after this action, she is dead (`character_dead`). This also results in a negative emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf upon discovering what happened.

Killing and eating the grandmother obviously results in her death, intensifying the `life_at_risk` tension for both characters involved. The emotional links turn strongly negative as LRRH would feel grief and hatred towards the wolf.

LRRH gathering flowers and nuts doesn't involve any character interactions, so no emotional links are affected here. However, since she's distracted, it might indirectly maintain her life at risk due to the delay in reaching her grandmother.

The wolf disguising himself as the grandmother leads to LRRH trusting him, which can create a false positive emotional link of friendship from LRRH towards the wolf (thinking he's her grandmother). This deception also keeps her life at risk as she’s unaware of the danger.

LRRH arriving at the house with the intent to visit maintains the `health_at_risk` tension for the grandmother, and upon finding the wolf, this might turn into a `life_at_risk` situation for herself. Emotional links would turn negative once she realizes the deception.

The wolf deceiving LRRH results in her trust turning into fear or anger, creating a negative emotional link towards him. Her life remains at risk due to the wolf's intentions.

LRRH getting into bed with the wolf, unaware of the danger, results in her life being at immediate risk and likely intensifies her negative emotional links once she discovers the truth.

Finally, eating LRRH by the wolf results in her death, creating a `character_dead` postcondition. This action would leave a lasting negative emotional impact on any surviving characters and resolve the `life_at_risk` tension as it turns into death.
