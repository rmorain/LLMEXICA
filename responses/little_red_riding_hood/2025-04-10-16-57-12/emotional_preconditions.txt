Alright, I need to analyze each action from the previous JSON output and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links are either 'friendship' or 'love', and their magnitudes range from -3 to 3.

Starting with "mother_sends_daughter_to_visit_grandmother". This action implies a strong positive emotional link, likely love, since the mother is showing care by sending her daughter to visit her sick grandmother. The magnitude would be high, maybe +3.

Next, "little_red_riding_hood_meets_wolf_in_forest" doesn't inherently have an emotional link precondition because it's just an encounter. So no preconditions here.

When the wolf asks LRRH about her grandmother, there might be a negative emotional link from the wolf towards LRRH or her grandmother, indicating hostility. Maybe friendship with magnitude -2 from the wolf to LRRH.

LRRH telling the wolf about her grandmother suggests trust, so a positive friendship link from LRRH to the wolf, perhaps +1.

The wolf running to the grandmother's house is driven by hunger or malice, showing negative emotional links towards both LRRH and the grandmother. Maybe -3 for both.

Killing and eating the grandmother requires a strong negative emotional link from the wolf to her, so -3 for friendship.

LRRH gathering flowers shows her positive emotions, maybe love for nature, but since it's not directed at another character, no preconditions here.

The wolf disguising as the grandmother implies deception, requiring a negative emotional link towards LRRH, say -2.

Arriving at the house, LRRH has a loving intent, so +3 from her to the grandmother.

Deceiving LRRH requires the wolf's negative feelings, perhaps -3 friendship towards her.

Getting into bed with the wolf indicates trust from LRRH, so +2 friendship towards him.

Finally, eating LRRH is driven by hunger or malice, showing a strong negative emotional link from the wolf to her, magnitude -3.

I need to ensure each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotional state for the action to occur, using the appropriate type and magnitude based on the story's context.
