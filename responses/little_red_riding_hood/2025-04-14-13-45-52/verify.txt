Alright, let's tackle this step by step to ensure everything is logically consistent in the JSON.

First, I'll go through each action one by one and verify that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved. For actions where only one character is involved, like "little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong," I need to make sure that only 'a' is referenced in preconditions and postconditions.

Next, I'll check for any deceased characters. Once a character dies (e.g., grandmother and LRRH), they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions. So, actions involving them after their death should not reference them in postconditions.

I'll also ensure that preconditions and postconditions are different. For example, if an action has a precondition of `health_at_risk` for the grandmother, the postcondition can't be the same; it might resolve with `health_normal` or escalate to `character_dead`.

For emotional links, I need to make sure they only use 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is the subject and 'b' is the object. If an action involves self-actions, both 'from' and 'to' can be 'a'.

Tensions must also align with the characters involved. For instance, if a wolf attempts to eat LRRH, the tension should reflect that her life is at risk.

I'll remove any actions where no postcondition can be identified or inferred because each action must have at least one postcondition.

Finally, I'll validate the JSON syntax to ensure all keys are present and correctly formatted. This includes checking that numerical values are properly written without a '+' prefix.
