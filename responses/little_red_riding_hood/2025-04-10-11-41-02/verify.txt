Alright, I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying each action's details against the given constraints.

First, for "mother_shows_love": It involves two characters, mother (a) and LRRH (b). The emotional link from mother to LRRH is love with magnitude 3. In postconditions, LRRH develops a positive link towards her mother, which makes sense without introducing any tensions.

Next, "character_meets_predator" involves two characters but uses '-' for subject and object since it's a neutral encounter. However, I need to assign proper 'a' and 'b' based on the action. Here, LRRH (a) meets the wolf (b), so 'from' and 'to' should reflect this interaction. The emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf is negative friendship due to fear, and the tension is life_at_risk for LRRH.

Moving to "predator_plans_deception": Only the wolf (a) is involved, so all references should be to 'a'. The existing negative link remains, and the tension of life_at_risk continues without change.

For "predator_kills_and_disguises": Involves wolf (a) and grandmother (b). The wolf's action causes the grandmother’s death, so postconditions shouldn't have any links from her. LRRH’s emotional link turns negative towards the wolf, and tensions remain as is without introducing new ones.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": Both characters are involved, but since it's a disguised interaction, LRRH (a) interacts with the wolf (b). Her initial positive link towards her grandmother turns negative when she realizes the truth. Tensions persist without resolution yet.

I need to ensure that 'a' and 'b' correctly refer to subject and object respectively, avoid any references beyond these identifiers, and prevent deceased characters from having further emotional links or tensions.

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action strengthens LRRH's positive feelings, ensuring consistency with no new tensions introduced.

2. **character_meets_predator**: Correctly assigns 'a' as LRRH and 'b' as the wolf, reflecting her fear and the ongoing life-at-risk tension.

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Maintains focus on the wolf's negative emotions without introducing new emotional links or tensions.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Reflects the grandmother's death and maintains existing tensions without illogical continuations of her emotional links.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Ensures LRRH's fear towards the wolf is captured, maintaining all relevant tensions without resolution.

This JSON now accurately reflects logical consistency, ensuring 'a' and 'b' correctly map to subject and object, avoiding any impossible states for deceased characters.
