Okay, so now I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Tensions can be things like a character being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.

Starting with "mother_shows_love": This action involves the mother showing affection towards LRRH. I don't see any inherent tension here because it's a positive action. So, preconditions related to tensions should be empty.

Next is "character_meets_predator": LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. This encounter introduces tension because the wolf poses a threat. Specifically, this creates a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH. The source of this tension is the wolf (object), and it affects LRRH (subject).

Moving on to "predator_plans_deception": The wolf plans to trick LRRH. This plan is driven by the existing 'life_at_risk' tension that was introduced in the previous action. So, this action requires that there's already a 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH.

Then we have "predator_kills_and_disguises": The wolf kills the grandmother and disguises as her. This action introduces two tensions: the grandmother's death ('character_dead') and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH because she's now in greater danger when she arrives. So, both of these tensions are preconditions here.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": LRRH interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This interaction is under the continued 'life_at_risk' tension as she's unaware of the danger. Additionally, since she believes it's her sick grandmother, there might be a 'health_at_risk' tension related to the grandmother's condition.

I need to make sure that for each action, I correctly identify whether any tensions must exist beforehand and specify their type, source ('from'), and target ('to'). If no tensions are required, the array remains empty.

Let me structure this into the JSON format as per instructions.

Here is the JSON with the preconditions related to tensions for each action:

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: No tensions are present here as it's a positive interaction between the mother and LRRH.

2. **character_meets_predator**: This action introduces a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH (subject) from the wolf (object).

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Requires an existing 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH, indicating the ongoing danger she's in.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Introduces 'character_dead' for the grandmother and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH upon her arrival.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Occurs under the ongoing 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH and acknowledges the 'health_at_risk' tension due to the grandmother's illness.
