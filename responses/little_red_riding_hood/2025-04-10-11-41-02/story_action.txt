Alright, I need to analyze the given story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. 

First, I'll break down the story into key events. The main characters are Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH), her mother, grandmother, and the wolf.

The story starts with LRRH's mother showing love by making her clothes and sending her to her sick grandmother with gifts. That establishes a loving relationship between them.

Then, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. The wolf tricks her, which introduces tension because he plans to eat her. This is a life-at-risk situation.

The wolf arrives first at the grandmother's house, eats her, and disguises himself. This creates the tension of the grandmother's death and the wolf's deception.

When LRRH arrives, she interacts with the wolf (disguised as the grandmother), leading to several moments where she notices something is wrong but doesn't realize it's the wolf. Each time she comments on the "grandmother's" features, it builds tension because the reader knows the danger.

Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats LRRH, which is another life-at-risk moment and results in her death.

Now, I'll map these events into actions focusing on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions. Each action should be in snake_case without character names and include subject, object, n_characters, and the type of link or tension.

I need to ensure each JSON object only includes the specified keys and that n_characters matches the presence of subject and object.

Here is the structured analysis of the story "Little Red Riding Hood" focusing on emotional links and tensions:

```json
