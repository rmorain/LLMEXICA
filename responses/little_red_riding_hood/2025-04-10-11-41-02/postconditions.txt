Alright, so now I need to identify postconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Postconditions are changes resulting from the actions—either emotional links or tensions.

Starting with "mother_shows_love": The mother's affection likely strengthens LRRH's positive feelings towards her mother. So, this would enhance their existing love link to an even higher magnitude. As for tensions, since there were none beforehand, nothing new is introduced here.

Next, "character_meets_predator": Meeting the wolf introduces fear in LRRH, creating a negative emotional link of friendship (as it's not romantic) towards the wolf. This action also heightens the tension of her life being at risk.

Then, "predator_plans_deception": The wolf's plan to trick LRRH increases her negative feelings towards him, intensifying the negative emotional link. It also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active since she’s still in danger.

Moving on to "predator_kills_and_disguises": Killing the grandmother removes any positive emotional links LRRH had with her grandmother and replaces them with grief or anger, turning it into a negative link. Additionally, this action introduces the 'character_dead' tension for the grandmother and keeps LRRH's life at risk.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": Interacting with the disguised wolf might initially maintain positive emotions from LRRH towards who she thinks is her sick grandmother. However, upon realizing the truth, it turns into fear or anger, thus creating a negative emotional link towards the wolf. This interaction also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active and introduces 'health_at_risk' for the grandmother due to her illness.

I need to ensure that each postcondition reflects changes in emotions or tensions resulting from the action, not repeating preconditions unless it's a resolution via normal tensions.

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: Reinforces the positive emotional link of love from LRRH towards her mother.

2. **character_meets_predator**: Establishes a negative friendship link from LRRH towards the wolf and maintains the life-at-risk tension.

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Maintains the existing negative emotional link and life-at-risk tension, showing no resolution yet.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Turns LRRH's love for her grandmother into grief or anger (negative link) and keeps the tensions of death and life-at-risk active.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Changes LRRH's feelings from trust to fear/anger towards the wolf, maintaining existing tensions without resolution.

This structure ensures that each action's consequences on emotional links and tensions are clearly captured in the postconditions.
