Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that happen as a result of the action, and they can either be emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required for each action.

I'll start by analyzing each action one by one:

1. **cares_for**: This indicates an increase in positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH. So, I'll note a non-romantic emotional link with increased magnitude.

2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar to above, trust is built, so another positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH.

3. **communicates_with**: Since LRRH talks to Wolf, there's no immediate change in emotional links unless it's negative due to future events. But since she doesn't know the danger yet, maybe a slight decrease or none.

4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf shows interest, which might create suspicion but not an immediate emotional link change.

5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares details with Wolf, possibly increasing trust on her side, so positive towards Wolf, but since he's deceptive, it could later turn negative.

6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf plans to trick Grandmother and LRRH, creating a negative emotional link from Wolf to both.

7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf tricks Grandmother, leading to her harm, so a decrease in trust from Grandmother towards Wolf if she knew, but since she doesn't, maybe a slight negative link after the action.

8. **falls_ill**: Grandmother's health is already at risk, so this might increase concern from LRRH and Mother, creating stronger emotional bonds.

9. **hides_identity**: Deception leads to harm, so negative emotional links towards Wolf from Grandmother and LRRH once they realize.

10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets Wolf in, leading to her death, so a significant decrease in trust if she had known, but as she doesn't, it's more about the tension of life at risk.

11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in Grandmother's death, creating a permanent negative emotional link from LRRH and Mother towards Wolf.

12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting to attack increases the tension of life at risk for LRRH.

13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, so slight trust but later turns to fear.

14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, leading to a negative emotional link towards the disguised Wolf.

15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases suspicion and fear, solidifying negative links towards Wolf.

16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming the negative emotional links and increasing the tension of life at risk.

17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in LRRH's death, creating a permanent negative link from Mother towards Wolf.

For each action, I'll map these changes, ensuring that postconditions reflect the outcomes accurately without repeating preconditions unless necessary.
