Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time focusing on identifying or inferring preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. 

I'll start by looking at each action and determining if any tension exists that must be in place for the action to occur.

1. **cares_for**: This is about emotional bonds, so no tension here.
2. **sends_on_errand**: Again, this is more about trust, not directly related to tension.
3. **communicates_with**: Just talking, no inherent tension unless specified.
4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf is curious but not yet a threat, so no tension.
5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares her plans innocently; no tension here.
6. **decides_to_deceive**: This implies the wolf has malicious intent, which could relate to `life_at_risk` for both Grandmother and LRRH since he plans to eat them.
7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf pretending to be LRRH, leading to danger, so `health_at_risk` or `life_at_risk` for Grandmother.
8. **falls_ill**: Directly indicates `health_at_risk`.
9. **hides_identity**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, putting her in danger, so `health_at_risk`.
10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, risking her life, so `life_at_risk`.
11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in `character_dead` for Grandmother.
12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf is waiting to attack LRRH, so `life_at_risk` for both.
13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to the disguised wolf, tension of `life_at_risk`.
14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH senses danger, implying `life_at_risk`.
15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases tension as LRRH realizes something's wrong.
16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his true intent, leading to immediate `life_at_risk` for LRRH.
17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in `character_dead` for LRRH.

I'll map these tensions to each action, ensuring that where a tension is a prerequisite, it's correctly noted as such.
