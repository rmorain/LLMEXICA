Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.

Starting with "cares_for" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.

Similarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.

When the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.

LRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.

Wolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.

When Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.

Wolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.

When LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.

Finally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.

I need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.
