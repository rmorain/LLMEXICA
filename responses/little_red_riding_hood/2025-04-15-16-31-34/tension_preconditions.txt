Okay, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story of "Little Red Riding Hood." The user has provided a list of actions with some emotional links already identified. Now, they want me to identify or infer the tensions that must exist as preconditions for those actions.

First, let's understand what tensions are. Tensions are specific types of risks or dangers that characters face in the story. They can be things like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. These tensions need to exist for certain actions to make sense.

For example, when the wolf attacks Little Red Riding Hood, there's a clear tension of `life_at_risk` because her life is in danger. Similarly, when the grandmother is eaten by the wolf, that creates a `character_dead` tension.

I'll go through each action one by one and determine if any tensions are acting as preconditions for those actions. If an action requires a specific tension to exist beforehand, I'll note it down with its type, source (`from`), and target (`to`). The source can be 'a' (the subject performing the action), 'b' (the object receiving the action), or '-' if there's no specific character involved. The target is similarly 'a', 'b', or '-'.

I should also ensure that I only include tensions that are directly related to the action and make sense in the context of the story. If an action doesn't require any tension to exist beforehand, I'll leave that array empty.

Let me start by looking at each action and determining if there's a tension involved:

1. **greet**: No inherent tension; it's just an interaction.
2. **express_affection**: This is about emotional links, not tensions.
3. **give_task**: Again, more about the relationship than tension.
4. **journey**: Could involve some risk, but unless specified, I won't assume.
5. **greet (wolf and Little Red)**: The wolf's intention creates a tension of `life_at_risk` for Little Red Riding Hood.
6. **share_information**: The wolf is planning something harmful, which implies a tension.
7. **plan_deception**: This is about the wolf's intent to harm, leading to tensions like `life_at_risk`.
8. **journey (wolf)**: The wolf's movement towards the grandmother introduces tension.
9. **gather_items**: No direct tension here.
10. **arrive (wolf at grandmother's house)**: Leads to the grandmother being at risk.
11. **knock_on_door (wolf)**: Precedes harmful action, so tension exists.
12. **deceive (wolf as grandmother)**: Creates a deceptive situation leading to danger.
13. **enter (wolf into house)**: Intrusion with intent to harm.
14. **attack (wolf on grandmother)**: Directly causes `character_dead` tension.
15. **hide (wolf as grandmother)**: Sets up for future tension when Little Red arrives.
16. **knock_on_door (Little Red)**: Unaware of the danger inside, creating suspense.
17. **deceive (wolf to Little Red)**: Maintains the deception leading to her danger.
18. **enter (Little Red into house)**: She enters an unsafe environment.
19. **question (Little Red)**: Sense of unease or suspicion, indicating tension.
20. **attack (wolf on Little Red)**: Direct threat to her life.

Now, for each action where a tension is present, I'll specify the type and assign 'from' and 'to' appropriately. For example, when the wolf greets Little Red Riding Hood, it's the wolf ('a') creating a `life_at_risk` tension towards Little Red ('b'). Similarly, when the wolf attacks the grandmother, it results in her being dead.

I need to ensure that for each tension, the 'from' and 'to' are correctly assigned as per their roles in the action. This helps in understanding who is causing or experiencing the tension.

Finally, I'll structure this information in JSON format as per the user's instructions, ensuring each action has a `preconditions` key with both `emotional_links` and `tensions` arrays. Each entry will detail the type of tension and its source and target.
