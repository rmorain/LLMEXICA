Alright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. 

Starting with "loses_ball": This event sets off the chain of actions, but by itself doesn't involve tension directly. So no tension here.

"cries": The princess is upset because she lost her ball, indicating emotional distress, which could imply that her mental health is at risk due to sadness. So maybe `health_at_risk` for the princess.

"promises_companionship": She makes a promise under duress of losing her favorite toy, suggesting some level of stress or coercion. This might relate to `prisoner` if she feels trapped by her promise.

"retrieves_ball": The frog retrieves the ball from the deep well, which could be risky for him. So perhaps `life_at_risk` for the frog as he's retrieving it from a dangerous place.

"runs_away": She runs away quickly, possibly indicating fear or urgency, so maybe her life is at risk if she doesn't escape, though this might be more emotional than physical.

"knocks_on_door": The frog insists on entering, which creates tension in the princess. This could be seen as a form of pressure or threat, maybe `life_at_risk` for the princess if she refuses.

"refuses_entry": She refuses entry, creating conflict and possibly putting her in a situation where she might face consequences, indicating `life_at_risk`.

"commands_obedience": The king's command adds authority to letting the frog in, which could increase tension for the princess, maybe `prisoner` as she feels forced.

"opens_door": Reluctantly opening the door introduces tension as the frog enters her private space. This might imply `health_at_risk` due to stress or anxiety.

"enters_castle": The frog entering creates ongoing tension in the castle environment, potentially indicating that characters feel their health is at risk due to discomfort.

"requests_lift": Requesting to be lifted up close could make the princess uncomfortable, suggesting her health might be at risk due to stress.

"lifts_to_table": Lifting the frog onto the table adds physical proximity, which might increase the princess's tension, indicating `health_at_risk`.

"requests_food": Sharing food together creates social tension and discomfort for the princess, possibly affecting her health.

"shares_meal": Eating together reluctantly could imply ongoing stress or anxiety for the princess, indicating `health_at_risk`.

"requests_sleep": Asking to sleep in her bed is a significant invasion of privacy, which might make the princess feel unsafe, indicating `life_at_risk` or `prisoner`.

"throws_against_wall": Throwing the frog indicates extreme frustration and urgency, suggesting that both characters are at risk of harm.

"transforms_into_prince": The transformation releases tension as the spell is broken, so no specific tension here.
