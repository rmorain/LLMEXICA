Alright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.

Starting with "loses_ball": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.

Next, "cries": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.

Moving to "promises_companionship": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.

Then, "retrieves_ball": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).

"runs_away": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.

"knocks_on_door": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).

"refuses_entry": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.

"commands_obedience": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).

"opens_door": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).

"enters_castle": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).

"requests_lift": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.

"lifts_to_table": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).

"requests_food": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).

"shares_meal": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.

"requests_sleep": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.

"throws_against_wall": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).

transforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.
