Alright, I need to address the user's request to add postconditions to each action or remove the action if it doesn't have relevant postconditions. The user provided a list of actions that currently lack postconditions and wants the JSON updated accordingly.

First, I'll go through each action one by one to determine appropriate postconditions. For example, when the princess loses her ball, this creates a tension because she's upset and can't retrieve it herself. So, the postcondition here would be that her emotional state becomes distressed.

Next, promising companionship might lead to a positive emotional link towards the frog, as the princess is hopeful about getting her ball back. This indicates a slight increase in her affection towards him.

Ignoring the frog's request could lead to increased dislike from the princess towards the frog, showing a negative postcondition.

Reluctantly letting the frog in shows obedience but also continued dislike, so there's no significant change in emotional links, just a slight reduction in negativity.

Sitting together might make the princess more comfortable with the frog, increasing her neutral affection slightly.

Sharing food could lead to mutual positive feelings as they bond over the meal, indicating an increase in affection from both sides.

Going to sleep together results in a romantic transformation, so this action leads to a significant increase in romantic affection between them.

Throwing the frog against the wall is driven by disgust and resolves the tension when he transforms into a prince, leading to a positive emotional link as she realizes her mistake.

I need to ensure each postcondition logically follows from the action. If an action doesn't have a clear postcondition, it should be removed, but in this case, all actions can have relevant postconditions added.
