Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.

First, I'll start with the first action: "cries".

1. **Action: cries**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).

3. **Action: promises_companionship**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.

4. **Action: brings_ball_back**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.

5. **Action: runs_away**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).

6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.

7. **Action: knocks_on_door**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.

8. **Action: opens_door**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.

9. **Action: sits_together**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.

10. **Action: eats_together**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.

11. **Action: demands_lift**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.

12. **Action: lifts**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).

13. **Action: asks_for_bed**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.

14. **Action: carries_upstairs**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.

15. **Action: throws_against_wall**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).

16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: -
    - n_characters: 1

    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.

17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**
    - Subject: Henry
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.

Now, let me organize this into the required JSON format.
