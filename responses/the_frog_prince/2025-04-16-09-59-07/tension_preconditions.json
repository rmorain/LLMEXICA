Okay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.

Starting with the first action:

1. **Action: cries**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.

3. **Action: promises_companionship**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.

4. **Action: brings_ball_back**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.

5. **Action: runs_away**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.

6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.

7. **Action: knocks_on_door**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.

8. **Action: opens_door**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.

9. **Action: sits_together**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.

10. **Action: eats_together**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.

11. **Action: demands_lift**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.

12. **Action: lifts**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.

13. **Action: asks_for_bed**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.

14. **Action: carries_upstairs**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.

15. **Action: throws_against_wall**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.

16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: -
    - n_characters: 1

    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.

17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**
    - Subject: Henry
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.
