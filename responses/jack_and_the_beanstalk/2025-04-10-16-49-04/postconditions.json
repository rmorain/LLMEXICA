Alright, I need to go through each action and identify both emotional links and tensions as postconditions. Remember, at least one postcondition is required for each action, and if there were preconditions, the postconditions shouldn't repeat them.

Starting with "mother_tells_jack_to_sell_cow": This action is the mother instructing Jack. The effect could be a strained relationship, so maybe a negative emotional link from Jack to his mother. Also, no immediate tension is introduced here.

Next, "jack_meets_man_at_market": Jack trades the cow for beans. This interaction doesn't inherently create an emotional link or tension, but it sets up future actions, so perhaps a neutral emotional link between them.

Third action: "mother_angry_with_jack". The mother's anger likely strengthens a negative emotional link towards Jack and might increase health-related tensions if their situation worsens.

"jack_sad_and_sleeps": Jack's sadness doesn't directly affect others but shows his internal state, so no new emotional links or tensions.

"jack_climbs_beanstalk": This action is adventurous. It might create a sense of hope or curiosity but doesn't directly impact emotional links or tensions yet.

"giant_wife_gives_food_to_jack": The wife's kindness could foster a positive friendship link from Jack towards her. Her action also resolves any immediate health risks, so 'health_normal' would be a postcondition.

"jack_takes_gold_coins": Taking the coins doesn't directly impact emotional links but might create new opportunities, resolving some tensions related to their poverty.

"wife_denies_jack_presence_to_giant": The wife protecting Jack shows her care, strengthening a positive friendship link from Jack towards her. It also resolves the immediate life risk, so 'life_normal' applies here.

Finally, "jack_gives_coins_to_mother": This action improves Jack and his mother's financial situation, which can strengthen their love bond positively.

I need to ensure that each postcondition is appropriate and doesn't repeat preconditions if they existed. Also, normal tensions should resolve specific risks like 'life_at_risk' or 'health_at_risk'.
