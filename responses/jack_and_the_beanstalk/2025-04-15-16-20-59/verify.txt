Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the story of Jack and the Beanstalk is logically consistent with the number of characters involved. This means checking `n_characters` against the preconditions and postconditions for emotional links and tensions.

First, I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **tells_to_sell**: Mother tells Jack to sell the cow.
   - `n_characters`: 2 (mother and Jack)
   - Postconditions include emotional links between both characters, so this is consistent.

2. **offers_magic_beans**: Man offers beans for the cow.
   - `n_characters`: 2 (man and Jack)
   - Emotional link from Jack to man, which makes sense with two characters.

3. **gives_cow**: Jack gives cow to man.
   - `n_characters`: 2
   - Emotional links are between both characters, consistent.

4. **scolds**: Mother scolds Jack.
   - `n_characters`: 2
   - Both emotional links and tensions are correctly set for two characters.

5. **asks_for_food**: Jack asks giant's wife for food.
   - `n_characters`: 2 (Jack and wife)
   - Emotional link from Jack to wife is appropriate.

6. **gives_food**: Wife gives Jack food.
   - `n_characters`: 2
   - Positive emotional links in both directions, consistent.

7. **threatens**: Giant threatens Jack.
   - `n_characters`: 1 (only giant)
   - Emotional link from giant to himself makes sense as a single character action.

8. **lies_to_protect**: Wife lies to protect Jack from giant.
   - `n_characters`: 2 (wife and giant)
   - Emotional links from wife to giant and vice versa are correctly set.

9. **steals_gold**: Jack steals gold from giant.
   - `n_characters`: 2
   - Negative emotional link from Jack to giant is appropriate.

10. **gives_coins**: Jack gives coins to mother.
    - `n_characters`: 2
    - Positive emotional links in both directions, consistent.

11. **steals_hen**: Jack steals hen from giant.
    - `n_characters`: 2
    - Negative emotional link from Jack to giant is appropriate.

12. **sees_stealing**: Giant notices Jack stealing.
    - `n_characters`: 2 (giant and Jack)
    - Negative emotional link from giant to Jack, consistent.

13. **chases**: Giant chases Jack.
    - `n_characters`: 2
    - Negative emotional link from giant to Jack, appropriate.

14. **steals_harp**: Jack steals harp.
    - `n_characters`: 1 (Jack)
    - Emotional link from Jack to himself is consistent as a single character action.

15. **kills**: Jack kills giant.
    - `n_characters`: 2
    - Negative emotional link from Jack to giant, appropriate.

I also need to ensure that postconditions are not the same as preconditions and that there's at least one postcondition per action. Emotional links should be of type 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', but in this story, all are non-romantic. Tensions like `life_at_risk` are appropriately applied where relevant.

After reviewing each action for logical consistency, ensuring correct `n_characters`, appropriate emotional links, and that postconditions represent a change from preconditions without duplication, the JSON object is verified to be consistent.
