Alright, I need to help the user enhance their previous JSON output by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. The goal is to identify or infer the emotional states that must exist for each character to perform a specific action.

First, let me recall the actions extracted from the story:

1. mother_instructs_sell_cow
2. jack_trades_cow_for_beans
3. mother_angry_at_jack
4. mother_throws_beans_out_window
5. jack_sad_and_sleeps
6. jack_climbs_beanstalk
7. giant_wife_gives_food_to_jack
8. giant-threatens-jack
9. giant_counts_gold
10. jack_steals_gold_from_giant
11. jack_gives_coins_to_mother

For each of these actions, I need to determine if there are any preconditions based on emotional links.

Starting with the first action: mother_instructs_sell_cow. The precondition here likely involves a negative emotional link from the mother towards their current situation (poverty). So, she has a strong negative friendship link towards 'b' (their situation), prompting her to instruct Jack.

Next, jack_trades_cow_for_beans. Jack must trust the man (positive friendship link) and be desperate enough (negative towards his poverty situation) to make this trade.

mother_angry_at_jack is straightforward. The mother has a strong negative emotional link of friendship towards Jack due to his actions.

When she throws the beans out, her anger continues as a precondition.

Jack's sadness after being scolded leads him to sleep without dinner, so his negative emotional state towards himself or the situation causes this action.

Climbing the beanstalk requires curiosity and hope. Jack must feel positively about the potential of the beans, so a positive friendship link towards the beanstalk or his future.

The giant's wife giving food is based on kindness towards Jack. She has a positive friendship link towards him.

The giant threatening Jack stems from suspicion or anger, indicating a negative emotional link towards Jack.

Counting gold shows possessiveness, which is a neutral or slightly positive link towards the gold itself.

Stealing gold requires Jack to have a negative emotional link towards the giant (greed or resentment) and a positive one towards his mother (desire to help).

Giving coins to his mother is driven by love for her, so a strong positive emotional link.

Each action needs these preconditions mapped. I'll structure each JSON object with the `preconditions` key containing an array of emotional links.

I have to ensure that the magnitude is between -3 and 3, using 'a' and 'b' to denote subject and object. Since some actions don't involve another character, I might use '-' or relate it to the situation.

Now, I'll go through each action step by step to assign these preconditions accurately.

This JSON includes preconditions for each action, focusing on the emotional links that must exist for the characters to perform these actions. Each precondition is based on inferred emotional states from the story context.
