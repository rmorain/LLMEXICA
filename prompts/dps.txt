Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). 

Here is a formal description:

```
Story = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.
Sequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.
Action = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.
String Character = <String>.
String Action = <String>.
String = Any character represented in ASCIII.
; = Begin inline comment.
```
Here is an example:
```
Sto ;1
Eagle_Knight Actor
Jaguar_Knight Actor
Eagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess
Jaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess
Princess Was_In_Love_With Warrior
Eagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior
Eagle_Knight Killed Warrior
Princess Attacked Eagle_Knight
Eagle_Knight Wounded Princess
Jaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight
Jaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight
Jaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight
Jaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight
```

Ensure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.
