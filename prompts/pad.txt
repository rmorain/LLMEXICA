Convert this JSON object into a structure called Primitive Action Description (PAD) language. 

Here is a formal description of the syntax:

```
The specification of PAD’s syntax is done in a story-grammar style.
Description of an Action = ‘ACT’, <String > <Number of Characters>.
Number of Characters = ‘1’/’2’/’3’.
Description of Preconditions = ‘PRE’, <List of Preconditions> (optional).
List of Preconditions = <Precondition>, {<List of Preconditions>}.
Precondition = <Pre-Emotional Link>/<Pre-Tension>.
Pre-Emotional Link = ‘E’ <from Character> <to Character> <Magnitude of Emotional Link> (<Type of Emotional Link>/’*’).
Description Postconditions = {<Description Post-Emotional Link and Position>}, {<Description Post-Tension>} (required).
Description Post-Emotional Link and Position = ‘POS’, <List of Post-Emotional Link and Position>.
List of Post-Emotional Link and Position = (<List of Post-Emotional Link>/<List of Position>),
{<List of Post-Emotional Link and Position>}.
List of Post-Emotional Link = <Post-Emotional Link>, {<List of Post-Emotional Link>}.
Post-Emotional Link = ‘E’ (<from Character>) <to Character> (<Magnitude of Emotional Link>)<Type of Emotional Link>.
List of Pos Tension = <Pos Tension>, {<List of Pos Tension>}.
Pos Tension = ‘T’ <Tension> <to Character> {<from Character> }.
Type of Tension = {“Ad” : “character_dead”, “Lr” : “life_at_risk”, “Hr” : “health_at_risk”, “Pr” : “prisoner”, “Ce” : “clashing_emotions”, “Lc” : “love_competition”}.
Intensity of Emotional Link = ‘-3’/.../’+3’.
Type of Emotional Link = {1 : “friendship”, 2 : “love”}.
Inline comments = ;some comment.
```

Here are some example actions in PAD:

```
ACT
Attacked 2
PRE
E a b -2 *
POS
E b a -3 1
T Lr b a 

ACT
Cured 2
PRE
T Hr b *
POS
E b a +3 1
T Hn b a
```

If there are no preconditions, omit the line containing “PRE”. Ensure that the same information contained in the JSON object is contained in the PAD structure. Ensure that negative numbers have a minus sign (-) before the integer and positive numbers have a plus sign (+) before the integer. Check for proper spacing. For emotional links and tensions, use the string literals “*” and “-” like before in the JSON object to indicate any character or no character.
Return your result between <PAD></PAD> tags.
