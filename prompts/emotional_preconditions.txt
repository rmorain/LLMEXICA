For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.

Each emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.

For example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. 

Emotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.

Preconditions are optional.

Identify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. 

Instructions for each action:
1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.
2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`
3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.
	A. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty
4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`
	A. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.
	B. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]
	C. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action
	D. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action
