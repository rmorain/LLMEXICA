Ensure logical consistency for each action. Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. 
Each action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.
Check the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.
Verify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.
Make sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.
Check that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Each tension must have `from` and `to` keys. `from` refers to the character causing the tension and `to` refers to the character receiving the tension.
Return this verfied and correct JSON object.
