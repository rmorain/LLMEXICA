For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.

Identify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.

Instructions for each action:
1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`
2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.
	A. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty
4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`
	A. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.
	B. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character
	C. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character
