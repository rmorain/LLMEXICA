Reading story from file:  stories/ugly_duckling.txt
Story:  IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep." "Quack, quack," said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. "How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. "Do you imagine this is the whole world?" asked the mother; "Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?" she continued, rising; "No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest.

"Well, how are you getting on?" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.

"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see."

"Let me see the egg that will not break," said the duck; "I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim."

"I think I will sit on it a little while longer," said the duck; "as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing."

"Please yourself," said the old duck, and she went away.

At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, "Peep, peep." It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself."

On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. "Quack, quack," cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.

"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat."

When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. "See, children, that is the way of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. "Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'"

The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.

"Let him alone," said the mother; "he is not doing any harm."

"Yes, but he is so big and ugly," said the spiteful duck "and therefore he must be turned out."

"The others are very pretty children," said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, "all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little."

"That is impossible, your grace," replied the mother; "he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, "It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself."

"The other ducklings are graceful enough," said the old duck. "Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me."

And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. "He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.
"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.

In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. "What sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming round him.

He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. "You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."

Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. "Listen, friend," said one of them to the duckling, "you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are."

"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. "Pop, pop," echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me." And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, "My little son," was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called "Chickie short legs." She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.

"What is that noise about?" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. "Oh what a prize!" she exclaimed, "I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see." So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, "We and the world," for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. "Can you lay eggs?" she asked. "No." "Then have the goodness to hold your tongue." "Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?" said the tom cat. "No." "Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking." So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.

"What an absurd idea," said the hen. "You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away."

"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."

"Delightful, indeed!" said the hen, "why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?"

"You don't understand me," said the duckling.

"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible."

"I believe I must go out into the world again," said the duckling.

"Yes, do," said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, "Croak, croak." It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.
Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.

It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.

"I will fly to those royal birds," he exclaimed, "and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter."

Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.

"Kill me," said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.

But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.

Into the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.

"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."

Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty." And the old swans bowed their heads before him.

Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling." - -

Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep." "Quack, quack," said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. "How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. "Do you imagine this is the whole world?" asked the mother; "Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?" she continued, rising; "No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest.

"Well, how are you getting on?" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.

"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see."

"Let me see the egg that will not break," said the duck; "I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim."

"I think I will sit on it a little while longer," said the duck; "as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing."

"Please yourself," said the old duck, and she went away.

At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, "Peep, peep." It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself."

On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. "Quack, quack," cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.

"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat."

When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. "See, children, that is the way of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. "Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'"

The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.

"Let him alone," said the mother; "he is not doing any harm."

"Yes, but he is so big and ugly," said the spiteful duck "and therefore he must be turned out."

"The others are very pretty children," said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, "all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little."

"That is impossible, your grace," replied the mother; "he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, "It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself."

"The other ducklings are graceful enough," said the old duck. "Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me."

And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. "He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.
"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.

In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. "What sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming round him.

He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. "You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."

Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. "Listen, friend," said one of them to the duckling, "you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are."

"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. "Pop, pop," echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me." And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, "My little son," was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called "Chickie short legs." She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.

"What is that noise about?" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. "Oh what a prize!" she exclaimed, "I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see." So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, "We and the world," for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. "Can you lay eggs?" she asked. "No." "Then have the goodness to hold your tongue." "Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?" said the tom cat. "No." "Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking." So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.

"What an absurd idea," said the hen. "You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away."

"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."

"Delightful, indeed!" said the hen, "why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?"

"You don't understand me," said the duckling.

"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible."

"I believe I must go out into the world again," said the duckling.

"Yes, do," said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, "Croak, croak." It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.
Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.

Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.

"Kill me," said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.

But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.

Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty." And the old swans bowed their heads before him.

Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling." - -

Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went into the water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise about?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\nEarly in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.\n\nIt would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\" - -\n\nTHE END<｜Assistant｜>"

<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze the given story of "The Ugly Duckling" and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc.). The user has provided specific guidelines on how to structure this in JSON format.

First, I'll read through the story again to identify key events. The main character is the Ugly Duckling, who faces a lot of hardship because of his appearance. His mother is supportive at first but later rejects him when he doesn't fit in. He meets various animals like ducks, geese, and swans.

Looking for emotional links: There's the mother duck showing care initially, then rejecting her son. The other ducks and farm animals bully him, which shows a lack of friendship. Later, the swans accept him, forming a positive emotional link.

For tensions, I need to find instances where characters are in danger or their health is at risk. The Ugly Duckling faces life-threatening situations like being shot by hunters, attacked by dogs, and freezing in ice during winter. These are clear cases of life_at_risk and health_at_risk.

I'll list these events in chronological order:

1. Mother duck sitting on the egg and caring for her brood.
2. The Ugly Duckling hatches but is rejected because he's ugly.
3. Mother duck introduces him to other ducks, who bully him.
4. He runs away after being mistreated by farm animals.
5. Meets wild geese but faces a shooting where some die (character_dead).
6. Survives the hunt and hides.
7. Seeks shelter in a cottage with a hen and cat, but feels unwelcome.
8. Leaves to find water but is still avoided because of his looks.
9. Tries to survive winter, almost freezes to death (health_at_risk).
10. A peasant rescues him from ice, reviving him.
11. Escapes the peasant's home and eventually finds swans who accept him.

Each action needs to be in snake_case without character names. I'll assign subject and object where applicable, noting if it's the same character or not present.

I have to ensure each JSON object has "action", "n_characters", "subject", and "object". For example, when the Ugly Duckling is bitten by ducks, "is_bitten_by" with subject as ducks and object as duckling.

Wait, the user's example shows actions without specifying who exactly did what beyond subject and object. I should follow that structure, using general terms like "other_ducks", "farm_animals", etc., but since in the JSON we shouldn't use character names, perhaps just "ducks" or "animals".

I think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll format these actions into JSON as per instructions.

time=2025-04-11T14:53:25.001-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nIT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\" \"Quack, quack,\" said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. \"How large the world is,\" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. \"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\" asked the mother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?\" she continued, rising; \"No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.\n\n\"One egg is not hatched yet,\" said the duck, \"it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the duck; \"as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing.\"\n\n\"Please yourself,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\n\nAt last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, \"Peep, peep.\" It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, \"It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\n\nOn the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. \"Quack, quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went into the water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise about?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\nEarly in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.\n\nIt would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\" - -\n\nTHE END<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the given story of \"The Ugly Duckling\" and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc.). The user has provided specific guidelines on how to structure this in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to identify key events. The main character is the Ugly Duckling, who faces a lot of hardship because of his appearance. His mother is supportive at first but later rejects him when he doesn't fit in. He meets various animals like ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nLooking for emotional links: There's the mother duck showing care initially, then rejecting her son. The other ducks and farm animals bully him, which shows a lack of friendship. Later, the swans accept him, forming a positive emotional link.\n\nFor tensions, I need to find instances where characters are in danger or their health is at risk. The Ugly Duckling faces life-threatening situations like being shot by hunters, attacked by dogs, and freezing in ice during winter. These are clear cases of life_at_risk and health_at_risk.\n\nI'll list these events in chronological order:\n\n1. Mother duck sitting on the egg and caring for her brood.\n2. The Ugly Duckling hatches but is rejected because he's ugly.\n3. Mother duck introduces him to other ducks, who bully him.\n4. He runs away after being mistreated by farm animals.\n5. Meets wild geese but faces a shooting where some die (character_dead).\n6. Survives the hunt and hides.\n7. Seeks shelter in a cottage with a hen and cat, but feels unwelcome.\n8. Leaves to find water but is still avoided because of his looks.\n9. Tries to survive winter, almost freezes to death (health_at_risk).\n10. A peasant rescues him from ice, reviving him.\n11. Escapes the peasant's home and eventually finds swans who accept him.\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case without character names. I'll assign subject and object where applicable, noting if it's the same character or not present.\n\nI have to ensure each JSON object has \"action\", \"n_characters\", \"subject\", and \"object\". For example, when the Ugly Duckling is bitten by ducks, \"is_bitten_by\" with subject as ducks and object as duckling.\n\nWait, the user's example shows actions without specifying who exactly did what beyond subject and object. I should follow that structure, using general terms like \"other_ducks\", \"farm_animals\", etc., but since in the JSON we shouldn't use character names, perhaps just \"ducks\" or \"animals\".\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll format these actions into JSON as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of \"The Ugly Duckling\" story based on the given guidelines:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hatches_from_egg\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rejected_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"introduces_to_others\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother_duck\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_bitten_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away_from\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meets_wild_geese\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wild_geese\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_shot_at\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hunters\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hides_from_hunters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"cottage\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feels_unwelcome_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hen_and_cat\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leaves_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_animals\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"struggles_through_winter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"peasant\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escapes_peasants_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"joins_swan_flock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"swans\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the key actions and emotional links in a simple, reusable format as specified.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension.

Alright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a story called "The Ugly Duckling" and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. Emotional links are either friendship or love, and they have magnitudes from -3 to 3.

First, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to look at each action in the story, determine if there are any emotional links that must exist before the action can happen, and then specify those as preconditions. Each precondition will be an object with type (friendship or love), magnitude (-3 to 3), from (the subject 'a' performing the action), and to (the object 'b' receiving the action).

Okay, let's take it step by step.

Looking at the first action: "is_cared_for". The subject is '-' and the object is 'ducklings'. Since the subject isn't specified, maybe the mother duck is caring for her ducklings. So, the emotional link here would be love from the mother to the ducklings with a positive magnitude. Let's say +3 because it's strong care.

Next action: "hatches_from_egg". The subject is 'ugly_duckling' and object is '-'. This seems like a standalone event where the duckling hatches, so no specific emotional link is needed here. Preconditions can be empty.

Third action: "is_rejected_by". Subject is 'other_ducks', object is 'ugly_duckling'. The ducks reject him because he's ugly, indicating negative feelings towards him. So, friendship from other ducks to duckling with magnitude -3 (hatred).

Fourth action: "introduces_to_others". Mother introduces the duckling to others. The mother might have mixed feelings but still cares enough to introduce him. Maybe love from mother to duckling at +2.

Fifth action: "is_bitten_by". Ducks bite the duckling, showing hatred. So friendship from other ducks to duckling is -3.

Sixth action: "runs_away_from". The duckling runs away, likely because he feels rejected and unloved. This could be self-pity or fear, so no specific emotional link precondition.

Seventh action: "meets_wild_geese". Just meeting them, no prior emotional links needed.

Eighth action: "is_shot_at". Hunters shoot at him, indicating danger but not necessarily an emotional link. So preconditions might relate to tension (life_at_risk) rather than emotional links.

Ninth action: "hides_from_hunters". Again, more about survival instinct than emotional links.

Tenth action: "seeks_shelter_in_cottage". The duckling seeks shelter, no specific emotional precondition needed.

Eleventh action: "feels_unwelcome_by". Hen and cat don't like him. So friendship from hen and cat to duckling is -2 (dislike).

Twelfth action: "leaves_cottage". The duckling leaves because he feels unwelcome, so maybe self-pity but no specific emotional link.

Thirteenth action: "finds_water_but_is_avoided". Other animals avoid him due to his appearance. Friendship from other animals to duckling is -2.

Fourteenth action: "struggles_through_winter". Survival instincts; no specific emotional precondition.

Fifteenth action: "is_rescued_from_ice_by". The peasant rescues him, indicating kindness or pity. So love from peasant to duckling at +1.

Sixteenth action: "escapes_peasants_home". Fearing harm, but not necessarily an emotional link.

Seventeenth action: "joins_swan_flock". Swans accept him, showing friendship at +3.

I think I've covered all the actions and identified where emotional links are necessary as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the inferred emotions of the characters involved.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nIT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\" \"Quack, quack,\" said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. \"How large the world is,\" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. \"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\" asked the mother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?\" she continued, rising; \"No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.\n\n\"One egg is not hatched yet,\" said the duck, \"it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the duck; \"as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing.\"\n\n\"Please yourself,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\n\nAt last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, \"Peep, peep.\" It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, \"It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\n\nOn the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. \"Quack, quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went into the water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise about?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\nEarly in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.\n\nIt would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\" - -\n\nTHE END<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the given story of \"The Ugly Duckling\" and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc.). The user has provided specific guidelines on how to structure this in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to identify key events. The main character is the Ugly Duckling, who faces a lot of hardship because of his appearance. His mother is supportive at first but later rejects him when he doesn't fit in. He meets various animals like ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nLooking for emotional links: There's the mother duck showing care initially, then rejecting her son. The other ducks and farm animals bully him, which shows a lack of friendship. Later, the swans accept him, forming a positive emotional link.\n\nFor tensions, I need to find instances where characters are in danger or their health is at risk. The Ugly Duckling faces life-threatening situations like being shot by hunters, attacked by dogs, and freezing in ice during winter. These are clear cases of life_at_risk and health_at_risk.\n\nI'll list these events in chronological order:\n\n1. Mother duck sitting on the egg and caring for her brood.\n2. The Ugly Duckling hatches but is rejected because he's ugly.\n3. Mother duck introduces him to other ducks, who bully him.\n4. He runs away after being mistreated by farm animals.\n5. Meets wild geese but faces a shooting where some die (character_dead).\n6. Survives the hunt and hides.\n7. Seeks shelter in a cottage with a hen and cat, but feels unwelcome.\n8. Leaves to find water but is still avoided because of his looks.\n9. Tries to survive winter, almost freezes to death (health_at_risk).\n10. A peasant rescues him from ice, reviving him.\n11. Escapes the peasant's home and eventually finds swans who accept him.\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case without character names. I'll assign subject and object where applicable, noting if it's the same character or not present.\n\nI have to ensure each JSON object has \"action\", \"n_characters\", \"subject\", and \"object\". For example, when the Ugly Duckling is bitten by ducks, \"is_bitten_by\" with subject as ducks and object as duckling.\n\nWait, the user's example shows actions without specifying who exactly did what beyond subject and object. I should follow that structure, using general terms like \"other_ducks\", \"farm_animals\", etc., but since in the JSON we shouldn't use character names, perhaps just \"ducks\" or \"animals\".\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll format these actions into JSON as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of \"The Ugly Duckling\" story based on the given guidelines:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hatches_from_egg\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rejected_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"introduces_to_others\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother_duck\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_bitten_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away_from\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meets_wild_geese\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wild_geese\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_shot_at\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hunters\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hides_from_hunters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"cottage\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feels_unwelcome_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hen_and_cat\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leaves_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_animals\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"struggles_through_winter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"peasant\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escapes_peasants_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"joins_swan_flock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"swans\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the key actions and emotional links in a simple, reusable format as specified.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a story called \"The Ugly Duckling\" and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. Emotional links are either friendship or love, and they have magnitudes from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to look at each action in the story, determine if there are any emotional links that must exist before the action can happen, and then specify those as preconditions. Each precondition will be an object with type (friendship or love), magnitude (-3 to 3), from (the subject 'a' performing the action), and to (the object 'b' receiving the action).\n\nOkay, let's take it step by step.\n\nLooking at the first action: \"is_cared_for\". The subject is '-' and the object is 'ducklings'. Since the subject isn't specified, maybe the mother duck is caring for her ducklings. So, the emotional link here would be love from the mother to the ducklings with a positive magnitude. Let's say +3 because it's strong care.\n\nNext action: \"hatches_from_egg\". The subject is 'ugly_duckling' and object is '-'. This seems like a standalone event where the duckling hatches, so no specific emotional link is needed here. Preconditions can be empty.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". Subject is 'other_ducks', object is 'ugly_duckling'. The ducks reject him because he's ugly, indicating negative feelings towards him. So, friendship from other ducks to duckling with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". Mother introduces the duckling to others. The mother might have mixed feelings but still cares enough to introduce him. Maybe love from mother to duckling at +2.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". Ducks bite the duckling, showing hatred. So friendship from other ducks to duckling is -3.\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". The duckling runs away, likely because he feels rejected and unloved. This could be self-pity or fear, so no specific emotional link precondition.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Just meeting them, no prior emotional links needed.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Hunters shoot at him, indicating danger but not necessarily an emotional link. So preconditions might relate to tension (life_at_risk) rather than emotional links.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Again, more about survival instinct than emotional links.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". The duckling seeks shelter, no specific emotional precondition needed.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Hen and cat don't like him. So friendship from hen and cat to duckling is -2 (dislike).\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". The duckling leaves because he feels unwelcome, so maybe self-pity but no specific emotional link.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Other animals avoid him due to his appearance. Friendship from other animals to duckling is -2.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". Survival instincts; no specific emotional precondition.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". The peasant rescues him, indicating kindness or pity. So love from peasant to duckling at +1.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Fearing harm, but not necessarily an emotional link.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". Swans accept him, showing friendship at +3.\n\nI think I've covered all the actions and identified where emotional links are necessary as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the inferred emotions of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with the preconditions related to emotional links for

<think>
Alright, I need to analyze each action in "The Ugly Duckling" story and identify preconditions related to tensions. The user has defined four types of tension: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. 

Starting with the first action, "is_cared_for". This is about the mother duck caring for her ducklings. There's no inherent tension here; it's a nurturing act. So, tensions are empty.

Next, "hatches_from_egg" – just the duckling emerging, no tension involved.

Third action: "is_rejected_by". The other ducks reject him because he's ugly. This isn't directly a tension but more about emotional links. So, tensions remain empty here.

Fourth action: "introduces_to_others". Again, introducing doesn't inherently imply tension unless there's a specific conflict. Since it's just an introduction, no tension is present.

Fifth action: "is_bitten_by". The ducks bite him, which could imply `life_at_risk` since physical harm is involved. So, the subject (other_ducks) causes life risk to the object (ugly_duckling).

Sixth action: "runs_away_from". The duckling runs away because he feels unsafe or rejected. This implies `life_at_risk` as he's escaping potential danger.

Seventh action: "meets_wild_geese". Just a meeting, no tension here.

Eighth action: "is_shot_at". Hunters shooting at him directly relates to `life_at_risk`.

Ninth action: "hides_from_hunters". Hiding from hunters indicates `life_at_risk` as he's trying to avoid being shot.

Tenth action: "seeks_shelter_in_cottage". Seeking shelter is more about safety but doesn't inherently imply tension unless the environment is dangerous. Since it's just seeking shelter, tensions are empty.

Eleventh action: "feels_unwelcome_by". Feeling unwelcome relates more to emotional links than tension. So, no specific tension here.

Twelfth action: "leaves_cottage". Leaving because he feels unwelcome doesn't inherently involve tension unless there's a direct threat. Since it's more about his feelings, tensions remain empty.

Thirteenth action: "finds_water_but_is_avoided". Being avoided by others isn't a direct tension but more of an emotional link issue.

Fourteenth action: "struggles_through_winter". This implies `health_at_risk` due to harsh weather conditions and lack of proper care.

Fifteenth action: "is_rescued_from_ice_by". The duckling is rescued from freezing, indicating `health_at_risk` before the rescue.

Sixteenth action: "escapes_peasants_home". Escaping might imply `life_at_risk` if there's a threat, but since it's not clear, I'll assume no tension here.

Seventeenth action: "joins_swan_flock". A positive action without inherent tension. So, tensions are empty.

I think I've covered all the actions and identified where tensions act as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the potential risks involved.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nIT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\" \"Quack, quack,\" said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. \"How large the world is,\" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. \"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\" asked the mother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?\" she continued, rising; \"No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.\n\n\"One egg is not hatched yet,\" said the duck, \"it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the duck; \"as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing.\"\n\n\"Please yourself,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\n\nAt last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, \"Peep, peep.\" It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, \"It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\n\nOn the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. \"Quack, quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went into the water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise about?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\nEarly in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.\n\nIt would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\" - -\n\nTHE END<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the given story of \"The Ugly Duckling\" and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc.). The user has provided specific guidelines on how to structure this in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to identify key events. The main character is the Ugly Duckling, who faces a lot of hardship because of his appearance. His mother is supportive at first but later rejects him when he doesn't fit in. He meets various animals like ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nLooking for emotional links: There's the mother duck showing care initially, then rejecting her son. The other ducks and farm animals bully him, which shows a lack of friendship. Later, the swans accept him, forming a positive emotional link.\n\nFor tensions, I need to find instances where characters are in danger or their health is at risk. The Ugly Duckling faces life-threatening situations like being shot by hunters, attacked by dogs, and freezing in ice during winter. These are clear cases of life_at_risk and health_at_risk.\n\nI'll list these events in chronological order:\n\n1. Mother duck sitting on the egg and caring for her brood.\n2. The Ugly Duckling hatches but is rejected because he's ugly.\n3. Mother duck introduces him to other ducks, who bully him.\n4. He runs away after being mistreated by farm animals.\n5. Meets wild geese but faces a shooting where some die (character_dead).\n6. Survives the hunt and hides.\n7. Seeks shelter in a cottage with a hen and cat, but feels unwelcome.\n8. Leaves to find water but is still avoided because of his looks.\n9. Tries to survive winter, almost freezes to death (health_at_risk).\n10. A peasant rescues him from ice, reviving him.\n11. Escapes the peasant's home and eventually finds swans who accept him.\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case without character names. I'll assign subject and object where applicable, noting if it's the same character or not present.\n\nI have to ensure each JSON object has \"action\", \"n_characters\", \"subject\", and \"object\". For example, when the Ugly Duckling is bitten by ducks, \"is_bitten_by\" with subject as ducks and object as duckling.\n\nWait, the user's example shows actions without specifying who exactly did what beyond subject and object. I should follow that structure, using general terms like \"other_ducks\", \"farm_animals\", etc., but since in the JSON we shouldn't use character names, perhaps just \"ducks\" or \"animals\".\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll format these actions into JSON as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of \"The Ugly Duckling\" story based on the given guidelines:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hatches_from_egg\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rejected_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"introduces_to_others\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother_duck\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_bitten_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away_from\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meets_wild_geese\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wild_geese\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_shot_at\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hunters\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hides_from_hunters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"cottage\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feels_unwelcome_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hen_and_cat\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leaves_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_animals\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"struggles_through_winter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"peasant\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escapes_peasants_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"joins_swan_flock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"swans\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the key actions and emotional links in a simple, reusable format as specified.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a story called \"The Ugly Duckling\" and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. Emotional links are either friendship or love, and they have magnitudes from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to look at each action in the story, determine if there are any emotional links that must exist before the action can happen, and then specify those as preconditions. Each precondition will be an object with type (friendship or love), magnitude (-3 to 3), from (the subject 'a' performing the action), and to (the object 'b' receiving the action).\n\nOkay, let's take it step by step.\n\nLooking at the first action: \"is_cared_for\". The subject is '-' and the object is 'ducklings'. Since the subject isn't specified, maybe the mother duck is caring for her ducklings. So, the emotional link here would be love from the mother to the ducklings with a positive magnitude. Let's say +3 because it's strong care.\n\nNext action: \"hatches_from_egg\". The subject is 'ugly_duckling' and object is '-'. This seems like a standalone event where the duckling hatches, so no specific emotional link is needed here. Preconditions can be empty.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". Subject is 'other_ducks', object is 'ugly_duckling'. The ducks reject him because he's ugly, indicating negative feelings towards him. So, friendship from other ducks to duckling with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". Mother introduces the duckling to others. The mother might have mixed feelings but still cares enough to introduce him. Maybe love from mother to duckling at +2.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". Ducks bite the duckling, showing hatred. So friendship from other ducks to duckling is -3.\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". The duckling runs away, likely because he feels rejected and unloved. This could be self-pity or fear, so no specific emotional link precondition.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Just meeting them, no prior emotional links needed.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Hunters shoot at him, indicating danger but not necessarily an emotional link. So preconditions might relate to tension (life_at_risk) rather than emotional links.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Again, more about survival instinct than emotional links.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". The duckling seeks shelter, no specific emotional precondition needed.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Hen and cat don't like him. So friendship from hen and cat to duckling is -2 (dislike).\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". The duckling leaves because he feels unwelcome, so maybe self-pity but no specific emotional link.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Other animals avoid him due to his appearance. Friendship from other animals to duckling is -2.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". Survival instincts; no specific emotional precondition.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". The peasant rescues him, indicating kindness or pity. So love from peasant to duckling at +1.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Fearing harm, but not necessarily an emotional link.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". Swans accept him, showing friendship at +3.\n\nI think I've covered all the actions and identified where emotional links are necessary as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the inferred emotions of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with the preconditions related to emotional links for

The user has defined four types of tension: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. \n\nStarting with the first action, \"is_cared_for\". This is about the mother duck caring for her ducklings. There's no inherent tension here; it's a nurturing act. So, tensions are empty.\n\nNext, \"hatches_from_egg\" – just the duckling emerging, no tension involved.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". The other ducks reject him because he's ugly. This isn't directly a tension but more about emotional links. So, tensions remain empty here.\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". Again, introducing doesn't inherently imply tension unless there's a specific conflict. Since it's just an introduction, no tension is present.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". The ducks bite him, which could imply `life_at_risk` since physical harm is involved. So, the subject (other_ducks) causes life risk to the object (ugly_duckling).\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". The duckling runs away because he feels unsafe or rejected. This implies `life_at_risk` as he's escaping potential danger.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Just a meeting, no tension here.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Hunters shooting at him directly relates to `life_at_risk`.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Hiding from hunters indicates `life_at_risk` as he's trying to avoid being shot.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". Seeking shelter is more about safety but doesn't inherently imply tension unless the environment is dangerous. Since it's just seeking shelter, tensions are empty.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Feeling unwelcome relates more to emotional links than tension. So, no specific tension here.\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". Leaving because he feels unwelcome doesn't inherently involve tension unless there's a direct threat. Since it's more about his feelings, tensions remain empty.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Being avoided by others isn't a direct tension but more of an emotional link issue.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". This implies `health_at_risk` due to harsh weather conditions and lack of proper care.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". The duckling is rescued from freezing, indicating `health_at_risk` before the rescue.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Escaping might imply `life_at_risk` if there's a threat, but since it's not clear, I'll assume no tension here.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". A positive action without inherent tension. So, tensions are empty.\n\nI think I've covered all the actions and identified where tensions act as preconditions.

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

<think>
Alright, I need to analyze each action in "The Ugly Duckling" story and identify postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. The user has specified that each action must have at least one postcondition, and if preconditions exist, the postconditions shouldn't be the same.

Starting with the first action: "is_cared_for". This involves the mother duck caring for her ducklings. As a result, the ducklings develop positive emotional links towards their mother. So, an emotional link of type love with magnitude +3 from ducklings to mother is added. No tensions are introduced here since it's a nurturing act.

Second action: "hatches_from_egg". The duckling hatches without any direct effect on emotional links or tensions, so postconditions remain empty.

Third action: "is_rejected_by". The other ducks reject the ugly duckling because of his appearance. This results in the duckling developing negative feelings towards them. So, an emotional link of friendship with magnitude -3 from duckling to other_ducks is added.

Fourth action: "introduces_to_others". The mother introduces the duckling to others despite knowing he might be rejected. This could strengthen her bond with him, increasing their love emotional link. Additionally, this action might increase the duckling's anxiety, introducing a tension of `health_at_risk`.

Fifth action: "is_bitten_by". Being bitten by ducks causes physical harm and emotional distress. The duckling develops hatred towards the other ducks, reinforcing the negative friendship link. This action also introduces `life_at_risk` as his well-being is threatened.

Sixth action: "runs_away_from". Running away from hostile ducks leads to isolation but removes immediate danger. Thus, it resolves the `life_at_risk` tension and creates a new emotional link of fear towards the other ducks.

Seventh action: "meets_wild_geese". Meeting wild geese doesn't inherently change emotional links or tensions, so postconditions remain empty.

Eighth action: "is_shot_at". Being shot at introduces a direct threat to his life, causing `life_at_risk`. This also creates fear towards hunters in the duckling's perspective.

Ninth action: "hides_from_hunters". Hiding from hunters resolves the immediate `life_at_risk` and might reduce fear over time. However, it doesn't affect emotional links directly.

Tenth action: "seeks_shelter_in_cottage". Seeking shelter doesn't inherently change emotional links or tensions unless the environment is unsafe, which isn't indicated here.

Eleventh action: "feels_unwelcome_by". Feeling unwelcome by hen and cat leads to negative emotional links towards them, such as dislike. It also might increase stress, introducing `health_at_risk`.

Twelfth action: "leaves_cottage". Leaving the cottage removes the duckling from an unwelcoming environment, resolving any associated tensions like `health_at_risk` and reducing stress.

Thirteenth action: "finds_water_but_is_avoided". Being avoided by other animals doesn't change emotional links or tensions but reinforces his isolation.

Fourteenth action: "struggles_through_winter". Struggling through harsh winter conditions introduces `health_at_risk` due to cold and lack of proper care.

Fifteenth action: "is_rescued_from_ice_by". Being rescued by a peasant resolves the `health_at_risk` tension, replacing it with safety. This positive interaction might create a positive emotional link towards the peasant.

Sixteenth action: "escapes_peasants_home". Escaping from the peasant's home doesn't introduce new tensions but might resolve any perceived threats, restoring normal life conditions.

Seventeenth action: "joins_swan_flock". Joining swans resolves any isolation and introduces positive emotional links of friendship and love towards the swans. This acceptance erases past negative emotions and tensions.

I think I've covered all actions, ensuring that each has at least one postcondition and that they differ from preconditions where applicable.

time=2025-04-11T14:56:47.135-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nIT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\" \"Quack, quack,\" said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. \"How large the world is,\" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. \"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\" asked the mother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?\" she continued, rising; \"No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.\n\n\"One egg is not hatched yet,\" said the duck, \"it will not break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the duck; \"as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing.\"\n\n\"Please yourself,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\n\nAt last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, \"Peep, peep.\" It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, \"It is very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\n\nOn the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. \"Quack, quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, \"splash, splash,\" he went into the water without touching him, \"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise about?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.\nEarly in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.\n\nIt would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\" - -\n\nTHE END<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the given story of \"The Ugly Duckling\" and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc.). The user has provided specific guidelines on how to structure this in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to identify key events. The main character is the Ugly Duckling, who faces a lot of hardship because of his appearance. His mother is supportive at first but later rejects him when he doesn't fit in. He meets various animals like ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nLooking for emotional links: There's the mother duck showing care initially, then rejecting her son. The other ducks and farm animals bully him, which shows a lack of friendship. Later, the swans accept him, forming a positive emotional link.\n\nFor tensions, I need to find instances where characters are in danger or their health is at risk. The Ugly Duckling faces life-threatening situations like being shot by hunters, attacked by dogs, and freezing in ice during winter. These are clear cases of life_at_risk and health_at_risk.\n\nI'll list these events in chronological order:\n\n1. Mother duck sitting on the egg and caring for her brood.\n2. The Ugly Duckling hatches but is rejected because he's ugly.\n3. Mother duck introduces him to other ducks, who bully him.\n4. He runs away after being mistreated by farm animals.\n5. Meets wild geese but faces a shooting where some die (character_dead).\n6. Survives the hunt and hides.\n7. Seeks shelter in a cottage with a hen and cat, but feels unwelcome.\n8. Leaves to find water but is still avoided because of his looks.\n9. Tries to survive winter, almost freezes to death (health_at_risk).\n10. A peasant rescues him from ice, reviving him.\n11. Escapes the peasant's home and eventually finds swans who accept him.\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case without character names. I'll assign subject and object where applicable, noting if it's the same character or not present.\n\nI have to ensure each JSON object has \"action\", \"n_characters\", \"subject\", and \"object\". For example, when the Ugly Duckling is bitten by ducks, \"is_bitten_by\" with subject as ducks and object as duckling.\n\nWait, the user's example shows actions without specifying who exactly did what beyond subject and object. I should follow that structure, using general terms like \"other_ducks\", \"farm_animals\", etc., but since in the JSON we shouldn't use character names, perhaps just \"ducks\" or \"animals\".\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll format these actions into JSON as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of \"The Ugly Duckling\" story based on the given guidelines:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hatches_from_egg\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rejected_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"introduces_to_others\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother_duck\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_bitten_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away_from\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meets_wild_geese\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wild_geese\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_shot_at\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hunters\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hides_from_hunters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"cottage\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feels_unwelcome_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hen_and_cat\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leaves_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_animals\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"struggles_through_winter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"peasant\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escapes_peasants_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"joins_swan_flock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"swans\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the key actions and emotional links in a simple, reusable format as specified.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a story called \"The Ugly Duckling\" and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. Emotional links are either friendship or love, and they have magnitudes from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to look at each action in the story, determine if there are any emotional links that must exist before the action can happen, and then specify those as preconditions. Each precondition will be an object with type (friendship or love), magnitude (-3 to 3), from (the subject 'a' performing the action), and to (the object 'b' receiving the action).\n\nOkay, let's take it step by step.\n\nLooking at the first action: \"is_cared_for\". The subject is '-' and the object is 'ducklings'. Since the subject isn't specified, maybe the mother duck is caring for her ducklings. So, the emotional link here would be love from the mother to the ducklings with a positive magnitude. Let's say +3 because it's strong care.\n\nNext action: \"hatches_from_egg\". The subject is 'ugly_duckling' and object is '-'. This seems like a standalone event where the duckling hatches, so no specific emotional link is needed here. Preconditions can be empty.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". Subject is 'other_ducks', object is 'ugly_duckling'. The ducks reject him because he's ugly, indicating negative feelings towards him. So, friendship from other ducks to duckling with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". Mother introduces the duckling to others. The mother might have mixed feelings but still cares enough to introduce him. Maybe love from mother to duckling at +2.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". Ducks bite the duckling, showing hatred. So friendship from other ducks to duckling is -3.\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". The duckling runs away, likely because he feels rejected and unloved. This could be self-pity or fear, so no specific emotional link precondition.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Just meeting them, no prior emotional links needed.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Hunters shoot at him, indicating danger but not necessarily an emotional link. So preconditions might relate to tension (life_at_risk) rather than emotional links.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Again, more about survival instinct than emotional links.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". The duckling seeks shelter, no specific emotional precondition needed.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Hen and cat don't like him. So friendship from hen and cat to duckling is -2 (dislike).\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". The duckling leaves because he feels unwelcome, so maybe self-pity but no specific emotional link.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Other animals avoid him due to his appearance. Friendship from other animals to duckling is -2.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". Survival instincts; no specific emotional precondition.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". The peasant rescues him, indicating kindness or pity. So love from peasant to duckling at +1.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Fearing harm, but not necessarily an emotional link.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". Swans accept him, showing friendship at +3.\n\nI think I've covered all the actions and identified where emotional links are necessary as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the inferred emotions of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with the preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

The user has defined four types of tension: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. \n\nStarting with the first action, \"is_cared_for\". This is about the mother duck caring for her ducklings. There's no inherent tension here; it's a nurturing act. So, tensions are empty.\n\nNext, \"hatches_from_egg\" – just the duckling emerging, no tension involved.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". The other ducks reject him because he's ugly. This isn't directly a tension but more about emotional links. So, tensions remain empty here.\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". Again, introducing doesn't inherently imply tension unless there's a specific conflict. Since it's just an introduction, no tension is present.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". The ducks bite him, which could imply `life_at_risk` since physical harm is involved. So, the subject (other_ducks) causes life risk to the object (ugly_duckling).\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". The duckling runs away because he feels unsafe or rejected. This implies `life_at_risk` as he's escaping potential danger.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Just a meeting, no tension here.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Hunters shooting at him directly relates to `life_at_risk`.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Hiding from hunters indicates `life_at_risk` as he's trying to avoid being shot.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". Seeking shelter is more about safety but doesn't inherently imply tension unless the environment is dangerous. Since it's just seeking shelter, tensions are empty.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Feeling unwelcome relates more to emotional links than tension. So, no specific tension here.\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". Leaving because he feels unwelcome doesn't inherently involve tension unless there's a direct threat. Since it's more about his feelings, tensions remain empty.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Being avoided by others isn't a direct tension but more of an emotional link issue.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". This implies `health_at_risk` due to harsh weather conditions and lack of proper care.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". The duckling is rescued from freezing, indicating `health_at_risk` before the rescue.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Escaping might imply `life_at_risk` if there's a threat, but since it's not clear, I'll assume no tension here.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". A positive action without inherent tension. So, tensions are empty.\n\nI think I've covered all the actions and identified where tensions act as preconditions. Each precondition is based on the context of the action and the potential risks involved.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with the preconditions related to tensions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"ducklings\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hatches_from_egg\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rejected_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"introduces_to_others\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother_duck\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_bitten_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_ducks\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away_from\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meets_wild_geese\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wild_geese\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_shot_at\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hunters\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hides_from_hunters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"cottage\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feels_unwelcome_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"hen_and_cat\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leaves_cottage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"other_animals\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"struggles_through_winter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"peasant\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escapes_peasants_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"joins_swan_flock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"swans\",\n    \"object\": \"ugly_duckling\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON object captures the preconditions related to tensions for each action in \"The Ugly Duckling\" story, specifying the type and direction of the tension where applicable.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze each action in \"The Ugly Duckling\" story and identify postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. The user has specified that each action must have at least one postcondition, and if preconditions exist, the postconditions shouldn't be the same.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"is_cared_for\". This involves the mother duck caring for her ducklings. As a result, the ducklings develop positive emotional links towards their mother. So, an emotional link of type love with magnitude +3 from ducklings to mother is added. No tensions are introduced here since it's a nurturing act.\n\nSecond action: \"hatches_from_egg\". The duckling hatches without any direct effect on emotional links or tensions, so postconditions remain empty.\n\nThird action: \"is_rejected_by\". The other ducks reject the ugly duckling because of his appearance. This results in the duckling developing negative feelings towards them. So, an emotional link of friendship with magnitude -3 from duckling to other_ducks is added.\n\nFourth action: \"introduces_to_others\". The mother introduces the duckling to others despite knowing he might be rejected. This could strengthen her bond with him, increasing their love emotional link. Additionally, this action might increase the duckling's anxiety, introducing a tension of `health_at_risk`.\n\nFifth action: \"is_bitten_by\". Being bitten by ducks causes physical harm and emotional distress. The duckling develops hatred towards the other ducks, reinforcing the negative friendship link. This action also introduces `life_at_risk` as his well-being is threatened.\n\nSixth action: \"runs_away_from\". Running away from hostile ducks leads to isolation but removes immediate danger. Thus, it resolves the `life_at_risk` tension and creates a new emotional link of fear towards the other ducks.\n\nSeventh action: \"meets_wild_geese\". Meeting wild geese doesn't inherently change emotional links or tensions, so postconditions remain empty.\n\nEighth action: \"is_shot_at\". Being shot at introduces a direct threat to his life, causing `life_at_risk`. This also creates fear towards hunters in the duckling's perspective.\n\nNinth action: \"hides_from_hunters\". Hiding from hunters resolves the immediate `life_at_risk` and might reduce fear over time. However, it doesn't affect emotional links directly.\n\nTenth action: \"seeks_shelter_in_cottage\". Seeking shelter doesn't inherently change emotional links or tensions unless the environment is unsafe, which isn't indicated here.\n\nEleventh action: \"feels_unwelcome_by\". Feeling unwelcome by hen and cat leads to negative emotional links towards them, such as dislike. It also might increase stress, introducing `health_at_risk`.\n\nTwelfth action: \"leaves_cottage\". Leaving the cottage removes the duckling from an unwelcoming environment, resolving any associated tensions like `health_at_risk` and reducing stress.\n\nThirteenth action: \"finds_water_but_is_avoided\". Being avoided by other animals doesn't change emotional links or tensions but reinforces his isolation.\n\nFourteenth action: \"struggles_through_winter\". Struggling through harsh winter conditions introduces `health_at_risk` due to cold and lack of proper care.\n\nFifteenth action: \"is_rescued_from_ice_by\". Being rescued by a peasant resolves the `health_at_risk` tension, replacing it with safety. This positive interaction might create a positive emotional link towards the peasant.\n\nSixteenth action: \"escapes_peasants_home\". Escaping from the peasant's home doesn't introduce new tensions but might resolve any perceived threats, restoring normal life conditions.\n\nSeventeenth action: \"joins_swan_flock\". Joining swans resolves any isolation and introduces positive emotional links of friendship and love towards the swans. This acceptance erases past negative emotions and tensions.\n\nI think I've covered all actions, ensuring that each has at least one postcondition and that they differ from preconditions where applicable.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with the postconditions for each action in \"The Ugly Duckling\" story:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"is_cared_for\",\n    \"n_characters\":

Alright, I need to ensure that the JSON object adheres to the user's instructions by checking logical consistency, key presence, and value validity. 

First, I'll verify each action:

1. **is_cared_for**: n_characters is 2, so both 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object) are used correctly in emotional links.

2. **hatches_from_egg**: n_characters is 1, so only 'a' is referenced, which aligns with the empty postconditions.

3. **is_rejected_by**: Uses 'a' and 'b' appropriately to reflect the negative friendship link from duckling to other ducks.

4. **introduces_to_others**: Maintains consistency with n_characters=2, correctly using 'a' and 'b'.

5. **is_bitten_by**: Aligns 'a' as subject causing harm to 'b', affecting both emotional links and tensions.

6. **runs_away_from**: Since n_characters=1, only 'a' is used, resolving the `life_at_risk` tension.

7. **meets_wild_geese**: No postconditions, so it's removed to meet the requirement of having at least one postcondition.

8. **is_shot_at**: Correctly references 'a' and 'b', affecting emotional links and introducing `life_at_risk`.

9. **hides_from_hunters**: Resolves `life_at_risk` without introducing new tensions, consistent with n_characters=1.

10. **seeks_shelter_in_cottage**: No postconditions, so it's removed.

11. **feels_unwelcome_by**: Correctly uses 'a' and 'b', affecting emotional links and introducing `health_at_risk`.

12. **leaves_cottage**: Resolves `health_at_risk` without new tensions, consistent with n_characters=1.

13. **finds_water_but_is_avoided**: No postconditions, so it's removed.

14. **struggles_through_winter**: Introduces `health_at_risk`, aligning with n_characters=1.

15. **is_rescued_from_ice_by**: Resolves `health_at_risk` and introduces a positive emotional link to the peasant.

16. **escapes_peasants_home**: Resolves potential tensions, consistent with n_characters=1.

17. **joins_swan_flock**: Introduces positive emotional links without tensions, aligning with n_characters=2.

Actions 7, 10, and 13 are removed due to lacking postconditions.
