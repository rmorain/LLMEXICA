Story:  Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.

First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!

Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.

Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.

By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window.

So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table.

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜>"

<think>
Alright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.

The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.

Looking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.

Starting from the beginning:

1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.

2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.

3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.

4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.

5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.

I need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.

Wait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.

In the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.

Similarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.

She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.

When the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.

Similarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.

Finally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.

So putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:

1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.
2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.
3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.
4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.
5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.
6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.

Wait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.

Also, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.

Similarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.

Wait, in the story:

- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).
- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).
- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.

So in JSON:

1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)
2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)
3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)

Then she sits in chairs:

4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)
5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)
6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)

Then sleeps:

7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)

Bears return and notice porridge:

8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)
9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)
10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)

Notice chairs:

11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)
12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)
13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)

Find Goldilocks asleep:

14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)

Then she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:

15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.

But in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.

I need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.

Similarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.

So action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.

Same with chairs and beds.

Now, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.

Additionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.

Finally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.

So in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.

Wait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.

But according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.

Wait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.

Alternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.

So in that case:

- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear
- sit_in_char: same structure
- sleep_in_bed: same

Similarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.

So compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.

time=2025-04-15T15:47:22.804-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.\n\n2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.\n\n3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.\n\n4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.\n\n5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nI need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.\n\nWait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.\n\nIn the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.\n\nSimilarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.\n\nShe sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.\n\nWhen the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.\n\nSimilarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.\n\nFinally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.\n\nSo putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.\n2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.\n3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.\n4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.\n5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.\n6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.\n\nWait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.\n\nAlso, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.\n\nSimilarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.\n\nWait, in the story:\n\n- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).\n- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).\n- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she sits in chairs:\n\n4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)\n5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)\n6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)\n\nThen sleeps:\n\n7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)\n\nBears return and notice porridge:\n\n8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nNotice chairs:\n\n11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)\n12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)\n13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)\n\nFind Goldilocks asleep:\n\n14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:\n\n15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.\n\nBut in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.\n\nI need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.\n\nSimilarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.\n\nSo action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.\n\nSame with chairs and beds.\n\nNow, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.\n\nFinally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.\n\nWait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.\n\nWait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.\n\nAlternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear\n- sit_in_char: same structure\n- sleep_in_bed: same\n\nSimilarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.\n\nSo compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"flee\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what they expect, including how to structure the JSON with preconditions, specifically focusing on emotional_links.

First, I'll go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary as preconditions for those actions. Since emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this story, it's all non-romantic, that simplifies things a bit.

Starting with the first action: Goldilocks tasting Great Big Bear's porridge. For her to take that action, she must have some level of curiosity or perhaps rudeness towards the Bears. So maybe a negative non-romantic link from her to them, but not too intense since it's just tasting.

Next, when she tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge, similar reasoning applies. She's still curious and possibly disrespectful, so another precondition with a slightly negative magnitude.

When she eats Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that shows more intent or hunger, so maybe the emotional link is stronger in terms of magnitude, perhaps indicating she feels entitled or very curious.

Then, when she sits in each Bear's chair, especially breaking Little Wee Bear's chair, there might be some frustration or carelessness on her part towards the Bears. So a negative non-romantic link with moderate intensity.

Sleeping in Little Wee Bear's bed indicates a sense of comfort or audacity from Goldilocks towards the Bears, so another emotional link, maybe slightly more positive since she feels comfortable enough to sleep there.

When the Bears find their porridge tampered with, they must have some trust issues or anger towards whoever did it. Since they don't know who yet, but we do (Goldilocks), perhaps a negative non-romantic link from the Bears towards Goldilocks.

Similarly, when they find their chairs tampered with, the same applies—frustration or suspicion towards the unknown person (Goldilocks).

When Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, that would likely evoke a strong reaction, so a more intense negative emotional link from him to her.

Finally, when Goldilocks wakes up and flees, she must feel fear towards the Bears, which is another emotional link driving her action.

I need to ensure each precondition's magnitude reflects how strong the emotional link is. For instance, actions like tasting porridge might have a lower magnitude (-1) compared to finding someone in your bed, which would be more intense (-3).

Also, I should map 'from' and 'to' correctly. Since Goldilocks is initiating most actions towards the Bears, her emotional links are from 'a' (subject) to 'b' (object). When Bears find their belongings tampered with, their emotional links are from themselves ('a') to Goldilocks ('b'), even if they don't know it's her yet.

This approach ensures that each action has appropriate preconditions based on the characters' inferred emotions.

The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.\n\n2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.\n\n3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.\n\n4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.\n\n5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nI need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.\n\nWait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.\n\nIn the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.\n\nSimilarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.\n\nShe sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.\n\nWhen the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.\n\nSimilarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.\n\nFinally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.\n\nSo putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.\n2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.\n3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.\n4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.\n5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.\n6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.\n\nWait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.\n\nAlso, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.\n\nSimilarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.\n\nWait, in the story:\n\n- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).\n- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).\n- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she sits in chairs:\n\n4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)\n5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)\n6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)\n\nThen sleeps:\n\n7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)\n\nBears return and notice porridge:\n\n8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nNotice chairs:\n\n11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)\n12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)\n13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)\n\nFind Goldilocks asleep:\n\n14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:\n\n15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.\n\nBut in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.\n\nI need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.\n\nSimilarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.\n\nSo action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.\n\nSame with chairs and beds.\n\nNow, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.\n\nFinally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.\n\nWait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.\n\nWait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.\n\nAlternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear\n- sit_in_char: same structure\n- sleep_in_bed: same\n\nSimilarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.\n\nSo compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"flee\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what they expect, including how to structure the JSON with preconditions, specifically focusing on emotional_links.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary as preconditions for those actions. Since emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this story, it's all non-romantic, that simplifies things a bit.\n\nStarting with the first action: Goldilocks tasting Great Big Bear's porridge. For her to take that action, she must have some level of curiosity or perhaps rudeness towards the Bears. So maybe a negative non-romantic link from her to them, but not too intense since it's just tasting.\n\nNext, when she tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge, similar reasoning applies. She's still curious and possibly disrespectful, so another precondition with a slightly negative magnitude.\n\nWhen she eats Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that shows more intent or hunger, so maybe the emotional link is stronger in terms of magnitude, perhaps indicating she feels entitled or very curious.\n\nThen, when she sits in each Bear's chair, especially breaking Little Wee Bear's chair, there might be some frustration or carelessness on her part towards the Bears. So a negative non-romantic link with moderate intensity.\n\nSleeping in Little Wee Bear's bed indicates a sense of comfort or audacity from Goldilocks towards the Bears, so another emotional link, maybe slightly more positive since she feels comfortable enough to sleep there.\n\nWhen the Bears find their porridge tampered with, they must have some trust issues or anger towards whoever did it. Since they don't know who yet, but we do (Goldilocks), perhaps a negative non-romantic link from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nSimilarly, when they find their chairs tampered with, the same applies—frustration or suspicion towards the unknown person (Goldilocks).\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, that would likely evoke a strong reaction, so a more intense negative emotional link from him to her.\n\nFinally, when Goldilocks wakes up and flees, she must feel fear towards the Bears, which is another emotional link driving her action.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition's magnitude reflects how strong the emotional link is. For instance, actions like tasting porridge might have a lower magnitude (-1) compared to finding someone in your bed, which would be more intense (-3).\n\nAlso, I should map 'from' and 'to' correctly. Since Goldilocks is initiating most actions towards the Bears, her emotional links are from 'a' (subject) to 'b' (object). When Bears find their belongings tampered with, their emotional links are from themselves ('a') to Goldilocks ('b'), even if they don't know it's her yet.\n\nThis approach ensures that each action has appropriate preconditions based on the characters' inferred emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n

<think>
Alright, so now I need to analyze each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions are specific situations that create suspense or conflict, such as a character's life being at risk, their health being in jeopardy, or them being imprisoned.

First, let me recall the types of tensions we're considering:

1. **character_dead**: A character has died.
2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.
3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.
4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.

Given the story, none of these tensions are explicitly present except for when Goldilocks jumps out of the window, which could put her life at risk. However, I need to carefully consider each action to see if any implicit tensions exist that might serve as preconditions for those actions.

Let's go through each action one by one:

1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:
   - This action involves Goldilocks tasting the porridge. There’s no direct tension here; it's more about curiosity or rudeness.
   
2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Similar to above, just another iteration with a different bear.

3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - Goldilocks eats all of the Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Again, no immediate tension unless we consider that her actions might lead to consequences later.

4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**:
   - She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair, which is too hard for her. No direct tension here.

5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Sits in Middle-sized Bear’s chair, which is too soft. Still no tension.

6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - She sits in Little Wee Bear's chair and breaks it. This could potentially lead to a situation where she injures herself or causes damage, but in the story, she just gets cross.

7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:
   - Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear’s bed. No immediate tension, but later on, this leads to her being discovered.

8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:
   - The Great Big Bear finds that someone has been at his porridge. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could be considered a tension related to security or property.

9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:
   - Similar to above; the Middle-sized Bear discovers his porridge was tampered with.

10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - Little Wee Bear finds that someone has eaten all his porridge, which is more serious than just being tasted.

11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**:
    - The Great Big Bear notices someone sat in his chair, adding to the sense of intrusion.

12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**:
    - Middle-sized Bear finds his chair was tampered with.

13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - Little Wee Bear discovers that someone not only sat in but also broke his chair, which introduces a situation where property damage has occurred.

14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:
    - This is the most significant tension. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, which directly puts Goldilocks at risk as she is caught trespassing and must flee.

15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**:
    - Goldilocks wakes up to the Bears’ voices. This is more of a reaction than a precondition for tension.

16. **flee (Goldilocks)**:
    - Finally, when Goldilocks flees by jumping out the window, this action inherently puts her life at risk, fitting the **life_at_risk** tension type.

Given these observations:

- **find_in_bed**: This action directly leads to a tension where Goldilocks’ life is at risk as she realizes she has been caught and must escape.
  
- **flee**: The act of fleeing introduces a clear tension of **life_at_risk** as jumping out the window could result in injury or worse.

For other actions, while there are elements of intrusion and property tampering, these don’t directly map to the predefined tension types unless we consider them under broader categories like security breaches. However, since the user has specified particular tensions, I will focus on those.

Therefore, only the **find_in_bed** and **flee** actions have direct preconditions related to tensions.

time=2025-04-15T15:49:45.176-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.\n\n2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.\n\n3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.\n\n4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.\n\n5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nI need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.\n\nWait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.\n\nIn the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.\n\nSimilarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.\n\nShe sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.\n\nWhen the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.\n\nSimilarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.\n\nFinally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.\n\nSo putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.\n2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.\n3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.\n4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.\n5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.\n6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.\n\nWait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.\n\nAlso, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.\n\nSimilarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.\n\nWait, in the story:\n\n- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).\n- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).\n- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she sits in chairs:\n\n4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)\n5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)\n6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)\n\nThen sleeps:\n\n7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)\n\nBears return and notice porridge:\n\n8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nNotice chairs:\n\n11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)\n12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)\n13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)\n\nFind Goldilocks asleep:\n\n14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:\n\n15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.\n\nBut in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.\n\nI need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.\n\nSimilarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.\n\nSo action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.\n\nSame with chairs and beds.\n\nNow, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.\n\nFinally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.\n\nWait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.\n\nWait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.\n\nAlternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear\n- sit_in_char: same structure\n- sleep_in_bed: same\n\nSimilarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.\n\nSo compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"flee\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what they expect, including how to structure the JSON with preconditions, specifically focusing on emotional_links.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary as preconditions for those actions. Since emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this story, it's all non-romantic, that simplifies things a bit.\n\nStarting with the first action: Goldilocks tasting Great Big Bear's porridge. For her to take that action, she must have some level of curiosity or perhaps rudeness towards the Bears. So maybe a negative non-romantic link from her to them, but not too intense since it's just tasting.\n\nNext, when she tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge, similar reasoning applies. She's still curious and possibly disrespectful, so another precondition with a slightly negative magnitude.\n\nWhen she eats Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that shows more intent or hunger, so maybe the emotional link is stronger in terms of magnitude, perhaps indicating she feels entitled or very curious.\n\nThen, when she sits in each Bear's chair, especially breaking Little Wee Bear's chair, there might be some frustration or carelessness on her part towards the Bears. So a negative non-romantic link with moderate intensity.\n\nSleeping in Little Wee Bear's bed indicates a sense of comfort or audacity from Goldilocks towards the Bears, so another emotional link, maybe slightly more positive since she feels comfortable enough to sleep there.\n\nWhen the Bears find their porridge tampered with, they must have some trust issues or anger towards whoever did it. Since they don't know who yet, but we do (Goldilocks), perhaps a negative non-romantic link from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nSimilarly, when they find their chairs tampered with, the same applies—frustration or suspicion towards the unknown person (Goldilocks).\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, that would likely evoke a strong reaction, so a more intense negative emotional link from him to her.\n\nFinally, when Goldilocks wakes up and flees, she must feel fear towards the Bears, which is another emotional link driving her action.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition's magnitude reflects how strong the emotional link is. For instance, actions like tasting porridge might have a lower magnitude (-1) compared to finding someone in your bed, which would be more intense (-3).\n\nAlso, I should map 'from' and 'to' correctly. Since Goldilocks is initiating most actions towards the Bears, her emotional links are from 'a' (subject) to 'b' (object). When Bears find their belongings tampered with, their emotional links are from themselves ('a') to Goldilocks ('b'), even if they don't know it's her yet.\n\nThis approach ensures that each action has appropriate preconditions based on the characters' inferred emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n

Tensions are specific situations that create suspense or conflict, such as a character's life being at risk, their health being in jeopardy, or them being imprisoned.\n\nFirst, let me recall the types of tensions we're considering:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n\nGiven the story, none of these tensions are explicitly present except for when Goldilocks jumps out of the window, which could put her life at risk. However, I need to carefully consider each action to see if any implicit tensions exist that might serve as preconditions for those actions.\n\nLet's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - This action involves Goldilocks tasting the porridge. There’s no direct tension here; it's more about curiosity or rudeness.\n   \n2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above, just another iteration with a different bear.\n\n3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks eats all of the Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Again, no immediate tension unless we consider that her actions might lead to consequences later.\n\n4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair, which is too hard for her. No direct tension here.\n\n5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Sits in Middle-sized Bear’s chair, which is too soft. Still no tension.\n\n6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - She sits in Little Wee Bear's chair and breaks it. This could potentially lead to a situation where she injures herself or causes damage, but in the story, she just gets cross.\n\n7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear’s bed. No immediate tension, but later on, this leads to her being discovered.\n\n8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - The Great Big Bear finds that someone has been at his porridge. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could be considered a tension related to security or property.\n\n9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above; the Middle-sized Bear discovers his porridge was tampered with.\n\n10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear finds that someone has eaten all his porridge, which is more serious than just being tasted.\n\n11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**:\n    - The Great Big Bear notices someone sat in his chair, adding to the sense of intrusion.\n\n12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n    - Middle-sized Bear finds his chair was tampered with.\n\n13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear discovers that someone not only sat in but also broke his chair, which introduces a situation where property damage has occurred.\n\n14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - This is the most significant tension. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, which directly puts Goldilocks at risk as she is caught trespassing and must flee.\n\n15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Goldilocks wakes up to the Bears’ voices. This is more of a reaction than a precondition for tension.\n\n16. **flee (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Finally, when Goldilocks flees by jumping out the window, this action inherently puts her life at risk, fitting the **life_at_risk** tension type.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **find_in_bed**: This action directly leads to a tension where Goldilocks’ life is at risk as she realizes she has been caught and must escape.\n  \n- **flee**: The act of fleeing introduces a clear tension of **life_at_risk** as jumping out the window could result in injury or worse.\n\nFor other actions, while there are elements of intrusion and property tampering, these don’t directly map to the predefined tension types unless we consider them under broader categories like security breaches.

These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action.

Alright, I need to go through each action in the Goldilocks story and determine the postconditions, which are changes to emotional links or tensions as a result of the action. For each action, I have to ensure that at least one postcondition is present and that if there were preconditions, the postconditions don't repeat them.

Let's start by recalling what postconditions involve:

1. **Emotional Links**: These can change based on the interaction between characters. If an action has a positive effect, it might create or strengthen a positive emotional link. Conversely, negative effects could lead to negative links.

2. **Tensions**: Actions can introduce new tensions or resolve existing ones. Special normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` can alleviate specific tensions if they were present in preconditions.

Given the story, most actions involve Goldilocks interacting with the Bears' property, which generally has negative consequences, leading to negative emotional links. The only significant tension arises when Goldilocks flees, introducing a `life_at_risk` situation.

Let's go through each action:

1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: This action likely leads to irritation from the Bears towards Goldilocks.
2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar negative impact on emotional links.
3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More severe impact as she consumes all his porridge, increasing negative feelings.
4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**: Discomfort or damage leads to frustration.
5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration but perhaps less intense than the Little Wee Bear's chair breaking.
6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**: Breaking the chair would lead to stronger negative emotions towards Goldilocks.
7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Invasion of privacy leads to trust issues and negative links.
8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: Discovery increases suspicion or anger.
9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar reaction to the Great Big Bear.
10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More upset due to the porridge being entirely eaten.
11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**: Frustration increases upon finding more intrusion.
12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration as with the Great Big Bear.
13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**: Anger or disbelief at the damage done to his chair.
14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Shock and anger at finding Goldilocks, leading to stronger negative links and introducing a tension of `life_at_risk` for Goldilocks.
15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**: Realization of being caught leads to fear.
16. **flee (Goldilocks)**: Escaping introduces the `life_at_risk` tension as she jumps out the window.

For each action, I'll determine how emotional links and tensions change. For example, actions where Goldilocks damages property will worsen her relationship with the Bears, while her fleeing introduces a direct risk to her life.

time=2025-04-15T15:51:28.479-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.\n\n2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.\n\n3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.\n\n4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.\n\n5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nI need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.\n\nWait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.\n\nIn the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.\n\nSimilarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.\n\nShe sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.\n\nWhen the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.\n\nSimilarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.\n\nFinally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.\n\nSo putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.\n2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.\n3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.\n4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.\n5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.\n6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.\n\nWait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.\n\nAlso, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.\n\nSimilarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.\n\nWait, in the story:\n\n- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).\n- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).\n- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she sits in chairs:\n\n4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)\n5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)\n6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)\n\nThen sleeps:\n\n7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)\n\nBears return and notice porridge:\n\n8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nNotice chairs:\n\n11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)\n12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)\n13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)\n\nFind Goldilocks asleep:\n\n14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:\n\n15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.\n\nBut in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.\n\nI need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.\n\nSimilarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.\n\nSo action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.\n\nSame with chairs and beds.\n\nNow, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.\n\nFinally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.\n\nWait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.\n\nWait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.\n\nAlternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear\n- sit_in_char: same structure\n- sleep_in_bed: same\n\nSimilarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.\n\nSo compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"flee\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what they expect, including how to structure the JSON with preconditions, specifically focusing on emotional_links.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary as preconditions for those actions. Since emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this story, it's all non-romantic, that simplifies things a bit.\n\nStarting with the first action: Goldilocks tasting Great Big Bear's porridge. For her to take that action, she must have some level of curiosity or perhaps rudeness towards the Bears. So maybe a negative non-romantic link from her to them, but not too intense since it's just tasting.\n\nNext, when she tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge, similar reasoning applies. She's still curious and possibly disrespectful, so another precondition with a slightly negative magnitude.\n\nWhen she eats Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that shows more intent or hunger, so maybe the emotional link is stronger in terms of magnitude, perhaps indicating she feels entitled or very curious.\n\nThen, when she sits in each Bear's chair, especially breaking Little Wee Bear's chair, there might be some frustration or carelessness on her part towards the Bears. So a negative non-romantic link with moderate intensity.\n\nSleeping in Little Wee Bear's bed indicates a sense of comfort or audacity from Goldilocks towards the Bears, so another emotional link, maybe slightly more positive since she feels comfortable enough to sleep there.\n\nWhen the Bears find their porridge tampered with, they must have some trust issues or anger towards whoever did it. Since they don't know who yet, but we do (Goldilocks), perhaps a negative non-romantic link from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nSimilarly, when they find their chairs tampered with, the same applies—frustration or suspicion towards the unknown person (Goldilocks).\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, that would likely evoke a strong reaction, so a more intense negative emotional link from him to her.\n\nFinally, when Goldilocks wakes up and flees, she must feel fear towards the Bears, which is another emotional link driving her action.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition's magnitude reflects how strong the emotional link is. For instance, actions like tasting porridge might have a lower magnitude (-1) compared to finding someone in your bed, which would be more intense (-3).\n\nAlso, I should map 'from' and 'to' correctly. Since Goldilocks is initiating most actions towards the Bears, her emotional links are from 'a' (subject) to 'b' (object). When Bears find their belongings tampered with, their emotional links are from themselves ('a') to Goldilocks ('b'), even if they don't know it's her yet.\n\nThis approach ensures that each action has appropriate preconditions based on the characters' inferred emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n

Tensions are specific situations that create suspense or conflict, such as a character's life being at risk, their health being in jeopardy, or them being imprisoned.\n\nFirst, let me recall the types of tensions we're considering:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n\nGiven the story, none of these tensions are explicitly present except for when Goldilocks jumps out of the window, which could put her life at risk. However, I need to carefully consider each action to see if any implicit tensions exist that might serve as preconditions for those actions.\n\nLet's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - This action involves Goldilocks tasting the porridge. There’s no direct tension here; it's more about curiosity or rudeness.\n   \n2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above, just another iteration with a different bear.\n\n3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks eats all of the Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Again, no immediate tension unless we consider that her actions might lead to consequences later.\n\n4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair, which is too hard for her. No direct tension here.\n\n5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Sits in Middle-sized Bear’s chair, which is too soft. Still no tension.\n\n6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - She sits in Little Wee Bear's chair and breaks it. This could potentially lead to a situation where she injures herself or causes damage, but in the story, she just gets cross.\n\n7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear’s bed. No immediate tension, but later on, this leads to her being discovered.\n\n8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - The Great Big Bear finds that someone has been at his porridge. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could be considered a tension related to security or property.\n\n9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above; the Middle-sized Bear discovers his porridge was tampered with.\n\n10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear finds that someone has eaten all his porridge, which is more serious than just being tasted.\n\n11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**:\n    - The Great Big Bear notices someone sat in his chair, adding to the sense of intrusion.\n\n12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n    - Middle-sized Bear finds his chair was tampered with.\n\n13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear discovers that someone not only sat in but also broke his chair, which introduces a situation where property damage has occurred.\n\n14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - This is the most significant tension. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, which directly puts Goldilocks at risk as she is caught trespassing and must flee.\n\n15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Goldilocks wakes up to the Bears’ voices. This is more of a reaction than a precondition for tension.\n\n16. **flee (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Finally, when Goldilocks flees by jumping out the window, this action inherently puts her life at risk, fitting the **life_at_risk** tension type.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **find_in_bed**: This action directly leads to a tension where Goldilocks’ life is at risk as she realizes she has been caught and must escape.\n  \n- **flee**: The act of fleeing introduces a clear tension of **life_at_risk** as jumping out the window could result in injury or worse.\n\nFor other actions, while there are elements of intrusion and property tampering, these don’t directly map to the predefined tension types unless we consider them under broader categories like security breaches. However, since the user has specified particular tensions, I will focus on those.\n\nTherefore, only the **find_in_bed** and **flee** actions have direct preconditions related to tensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the Goldilocks story and determine the postconditions, which are changes to emotional links or tensions as a result of the action. For each action, I have to ensure that at least one postcondition is present and that if there were preconditions, the postconditions don't repeat them.\n\nLet's start by recalling what postconditions involve:\n\n1. **Emotional Links**: These can change based on the interaction between characters. If an action has a positive effect, it might create or strengthen a positive emotional link. Conversely, negative effects could lead to negative links.\n\n2. **Tensions**: Actions can introduce new tensions or resolve existing ones. Special normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` can alleviate specific tensions if they were present in preconditions.\n\nGiven the story, most actions involve Goldilocks interacting with the Bears' property, which generally has negative consequences, leading to negative emotional links. The only significant tension arises when Goldilocks flees, introducing a `life_at_risk` situation.\n\nLet's go through each action:\n\n1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: This action likely leads to irritation from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar negative impact on emotional links.\n3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More severe impact as she consumes all his porridge, increasing negative feelings.\n4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**: Discomfort or damage leads to frustration.\n5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration but perhaps less intense than the Little Wee Bear's chair breaking.\n6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**: Breaking the chair would lead to stronger negative emotions towards Goldilocks.\n7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Invasion of privacy leads to trust issues and negative links.\n8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: Discovery increases suspicion or anger.\n9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar reaction to the Great Big Bear.\n10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More upset due to the porridge being entirely eaten.\n11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**: Frustration increases upon finding more intrusion.\n12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration as with the Great Big Bear.\n13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**: Anger or disbelief at the damage done to his chair.\n14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Shock and anger at finding Goldilocks, leading to stronger negative links and introducing a tension of `life_at_risk` for Goldilocks.\n15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**: Realization of being caught leads to fear.\n16. **flee (Goldilocks)**: Escaping introduces the `life_at_risk` tension as she jumps out the window.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine how emotional links and tensions change. For example, actions where Goldilocks damages property will worsen her relationship with the Bears, while her fleeing introduces a direct risk to her life.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, so I've gone through each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears to ensure logical consistency. I checked that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved in each action, making sure that when there's only one character, like in 'wake_up' or 'flee', it's correctly set to 1 with appropriate references.

I verified that postconditions are indeed changes from preconditions and that no dead character continues to have emotional links. Since none of the Bears die in this story, I didn't need to handle that specific case, but I kept it in mind for completeness.

For each action, I made sure there's at least one postcondition, either a change in an emotional link or a tension. For example, when Goldilocks 'flee's, it introduces a `life_at_risk` tension, which is then resolved as she escapes, though the story doesn't confirm her fate.

I also ensured that all JSON keys are correctly formatted, with appropriate values for emotional links and tensions. I avoided any illogical situations where a character might have postconditions that don't make sense given their state in the story.

Finally, I reviewed each action to ensure it's abstractly named without referencing specific characters, maintaining consistency across all entries.

time=2025-04-15T15:53:03.212-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of the events and the interactions between the characters. The main characters here are Goldilocks and the three bears: Great Big Bear, Middle-sized Bear, and Little Wee Bear.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). Since this is a fairy tale, I don't expect any romantic emotional links. The focus will be on non-romantic relationships between Goldilocks and the bears, which are mostly negative due to her trespassing.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks enters the Bears' house without permission, tastes their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then flees when they discover her. Each of these actions can be broken down into specific actions with subjects and objects.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Goldilocks looks through the window, peeps in at the keyhole, lifts the latch, and enters the house. These are all actions without direct interaction between characters, so I might not include them unless they relate to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no immediate tension here other than her trespassing, which is more of a setup.\n\n2. She tastes each Bear's porridge. This action involves Goldilocks (subject) and each Bear (object). However, the story doesn't mention the Bears' reactions until later, so the emotional link here is non-romantic, likely negative from the Bears towards Goldilocks after they discover her actions.\n\n3. She sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. Again, similar to above—actions with subjects and objects but no immediate emotional interactions beyond the consequences of her actions.\n\n4. She sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, which is where the Bears find her. This leads to the tension where Goldilocks' life might be at risk as she flees by jumping out the window. So here, 'life_at_risk' comes into play when she jumps.\n\n5. The Bears discover their porridge has been tasted and chairs sat in. Each Bear notices someone has been at their things, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nI need to map these events as actions in JSON format with action keys, n_characters, subject, and object. Since all interactions are between Goldilocks and each Bear, but sometimes multiple Bears are involved, I have to consider each individually.\n\nWait, no, actually, when she tastes porridge or sits in chairs, it's one-on-one actions with each Bear. So each action should be separate for each Bear if possible, but sometimes the story groups them together.\n\nIn the story, Goldilocks first tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, then Middle-sized, then Little Wee Bear's. Each of these is a separate 'taste_porridge' action with each Bear as object.\n\nSimilarly, when she sits in their chairs, it's three separate actions: sit_in_great_big_bear's chair (too hard), middle-sized (too soft), and Little Wee Bear's (just right but breaks). So that would be three 'sit_in_char' actions with each Bear as object.\n\nShe sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed, so one action there.\n\nWhen the Bears return, they notice their porridge has been tasted. Each Bear notices their own porridge, leading to exclamations. These are separate actions where each Bear is the subject and Goldilocks (unbeknownst to them) is the object.\n\nSimilarly, when they check their chairs, each Bear finds someone sat in their chair—again three actions with each Bear as subject and Goldilocks as object.\n\nFinally, Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed. This leads to her waking up and fleeing, which introduces a tension of life_at_risk as she jumps out the window.\n\nSo putting this together, I'll list these actions chronologically:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes each Bear's porridge: three 'taste_porridge' actions.\n2. She sits in their chairs: three 'sit_in_char' actions.\n3. Sleeps in Little Wee Bear's bed: one 'sleep_in_bed'.\n4. Bears return and notice porridge tampered with: three 'find_tampered_porridge'.\n5. Notice chairs: three 'find_chair_tampered'.\n6. Find Goldilocks asleep: one action leading to tension.\n\nWait, but the JSON should include each specific event, so I need to ensure each Bear's individual actions are captured.\n\nAlso, when she breaks the chair, it's an effect of her sitting in it, which adds a postcondition, but the user only wants actions, not effects. So focusing on the action 'sit_in_char' and whether it results in breaking is more about the state change, but for the action itself, it's just sitting.\n\nSimilarly, when she eats all Little Wee Bear's porridge, that's an action beyond just tasting—it's 'eat_porridge'. So perhaps I need to split the actions: taste vs eat. The first two are tasted, but the third is eaten entirely.\n\nWait, in the story:\n\n- She tasted Great Big Bear's porridge (too hot).\n- Tasted Middle-sized's (too cold).\n- Then she went to Little Wee Bear's, tasted it, liked it, and ate it all up. So that would be two actions: 'taste_porridge' for each of the first two Bears, then 'eat_porridge' for the third.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n1. taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n2. taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n3. eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she sits in chairs:\n\n4. sit_in_char (Great Big Bear's chair)\n5. sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear's chair)\n6. sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear's chair, which breaks)\n\nThen sleeps:\n\n7. sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear's bed)\n\nBears return and notice porridge:\n\n8. find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)\n9. find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)\n10. find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)\n\nNotice chairs:\n\n11. find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)\n12. find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)\n13. find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)\n\nFind Goldilocks asleep:\n\n14. find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)\n\nThen she wakes up and flees, leading to tension:\n\n15. life_at_risk when she jumps out.\n\nBut in the JSON structure, each action is an object with action, n_characters, subject, object. So for each of these steps 1-15, I can map them accordingly.\n\nI need to ensure that for each action, if it's between two characters (subject and object), they are listed correctly. For example, when Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge, the action is 'taste_porridge', subject: Goldilocks, object: Great Big Bear.\n\nSimilarly, when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tampered with, the action would be 'find_tampered_porridge', subject: Great Big Bear, object: Goldilocks (even though he doesn't know it's her yet). But in reality, from the Bears' perspective, they don't know who did it, so maybe the object is '-' or not applicable. Wait, but the action is about someone else affecting their property. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for these actions where a Bear notices something wrong with their belongings, the subject is the Bear, and the object would be Goldilocks since she's the one who caused it, even if they don't know her yet. So in the JSON, I can include her as the object because she is the cause.\n\nSo action 'find_tampered_porridge' for Great Big Bear would have subject: Great Big Bear and object: Goldilocks.\n\nSame with chairs and beds.\n\nNow, considering that each Bear's porridge tasting and chair sitting are separate actions, I'll list them accordingly in chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's a result of her sitting, but since the action is just 'sit_in_char', the breaking is an effect. However, the user wants to focus on the action itself, so we don't need to include the outcome unless it affects another action or tension.\n\nFinally, when she flees by jumping out the window, that introduces a life_at_risk tension because she might get hurt, which is one of the specified tensions.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll structure each action with the appropriate subject and object. For actions where only Goldilocks is involved (like her fleeing), the subject would be her, and there's no direct object unless it's about another character. But since she's acting alone in that moment, maybe n_characters is 1.\n\nWait, for 'flee', the action is just her leaving, so subject: Goldilocks, object: '-', n_characters=1.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the action lacks a subject or object, use '-'. So actions like sleeping would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear's bed? Wait no, because we're supposed to include only character objects. Since beds are inanimate, perhaps for 'sleep_in_bed', the object is '-' since it's an action on an inanimate object.\n\nWait, but earlier when she eats porridge or sits in chairs, those are actions where subject is Goldilocks and object is a Bear because their property was involved. But in the case of sleeping in bed, if the bed belongs to Little Wee Bear, perhaps the action 'sleep_in_bed' would have subject: Goldilocks and object: Little Wee Bear.\n\nAlternatively, since she's using his bed without his permission, maybe it's considered an action affecting him indirectly. So for actions like 'eat_porridge', 'sit_in_char', and 'sleep_in_bed', each Bear is the object because their belongings are involved.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- eat_porridge: subject Goldilocks, object Little Wee Bear\n- sit_in_char: same structure\n- sleep_in_bed: same\n\nSimilarly, when Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's their action of discovering, so subject is the Bear, and object is Goldilocks because she caused it.\n\nSo compiling all this, I'll create a JSON array where each element represents an action as per above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in_char\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_tampered_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_chair_tampered\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"flee\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what they expect, including how to structure the JSON with preconditions, specifically focusing on emotional_links.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one and think about what emotional links might be necessary as preconditions for those actions. Since emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this story, it's all non-romantic, that simplifies things a bit.\n\nStarting with the first action: Goldilocks tasting Great Big Bear's porridge. For her to take that action, she must have some level of curiosity or perhaps rudeness towards the Bears. So maybe a negative non-romantic link from her to them, but not too intense since it's just tasting.\n\nNext, when she tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge, similar reasoning applies. She's still curious and possibly disrespectful, so another precondition with a slightly negative magnitude.\n\nWhen she eats Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that shows more intent or hunger, so maybe the emotional link is stronger in terms of magnitude, perhaps indicating she feels entitled or very curious.\n\nThen, when she sits in each Bear's chair, especially breaking Little Wee Bear's chair, there might be some frustration or carelessness on her part towards the Bears. So a negative non-romantic link with moderate intensity.\n\nSleeping in Little Wee Bear's bed indicates a sense of comfort or audacity from Goldilocks towards the Bears, so another emotional link, maybe slightly more positive since she feels comfortable enough to sleep there.\n\nWhen the Bears find their porridge tampered with, they must have some trust issues or anger towards whoever did it. Since they don't know who yet, but we do (Goldilocks), perhaps a negative non-romantic link from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nSimilarly, when they find their chairs tampered with, the same applies—frustration or suspicion towards the unknown person (Goldilocks).\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, that would likely evoke a strong reaction, so a more intense negative emotional link from him to her.\n\nFinally, when Goldilocks wakes up and flees, she must feel fear towards the Bears, which is another emotional link driving her action.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition's magnitude reflects how strong the emotional link is. For instance, actions like tasting porridge might have a lower magnitude (-1) compared to finding someone in your bed, which would be more intense (-3).\n\nAlso, I should map 'from' and 'to' correctly. Since Goldilocks is initiating most actions towards the Bears, her emotional links are from 'a' (subject) to 'b' (object). When Bears find their belongings tampered with, their emotional links are from themselves ('a') to Goldilocks ('b'), even if they don't know it's her yet.\n\nThis approach ensures that each action has appropriate preconditions based on the characters' inferred emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n

action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so now I need to analyze each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions are specific situations that create suspense or conflict, such as a character's life being at risk, their health being in jeopardy, or them being imprisoned.\n\nFirst, let me recall the types of tensions we're considering:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n\nGiven the story, none of these tensions are explicitly present except for when Goldilocks jumps out of the window, which could put her life at risk. However, I need to carefully consider each action to see if any implicit tensions exist that might serve as preconditions for those actions.\n\nLet's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - This action involves Goldilocks tasting the porridge. There’s no direct tension here; it's more about curiosity or rudeness.\n   \n2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above, just another iteration with a different bear.\n\n3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks eats all of the Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Again, no immediate tension unless we consider that her actions might lead to consequences later.\n\n4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair, which is too hard for her. No direct tension here.\n\n5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Sits in Middle-sized Bear’s chair, which is too soft. Still no tension.\n\n6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - She sits in Little Wee Bear's chair and breaks it. This could potentially lead to a situation where she injures herself or causes damage, but in the story, she just gets cross.\n\n7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n   - Goldilocks sleeps in Little Wee Bear’s bed. No immediate tension, but later on, this leads to her being discovered.\n\n8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**:\n   - The Great Big Bear finds that someone has been at his porridge. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could be considered a tension related to security or property.\n\n9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n   - Similar to above; the Middle-sized Bear discovers his porridge was tampered with.\n\n10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear finds that someone has eaten all his porridge, which is more serious than just being tasted.\n\n11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**:\n    - The Great Big Bear notices someone sat in his chair, adding to the sense of intrusion.\n\n12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**:\n    - Middle-sized Bear finds his chair was tampered with.\n\n13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - Little Wee Bear discovers that someone not only sat in but also broke his chair, which introduces a situation where property damage has occurred.\n\n14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**:\n    - This is the most significant tension. Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep in his bed, which directly puts Goldilocks at risk as she is caught trespassing and must flee.\n\n15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Goldilocks wakes up to the Bears’ voices. This is more of a reaction than a precondition for tension.\n\n16. **flee (Goldilocks)**:\n    - Finally, when Goldilocks flees by jumping out the window, this action inherently puts her life at risk, fitting the **life_at_risk** tension type.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **find_in_bed**: This action directly leads to a tension where Goldilocks’ life is at risk as she realizes she has been caught and must escape.\n  \n- **flee**: The act of fleeing introduces a clear tension of **life_at_risk** as jumping out the window could result in injury or worse.\n\nFor other actions, while there are elements of intrusion and property tampering, these don’t directly map to the predefined tension types unless we consider them under broader categories like security breaches. However, since the user has specified particular tensions, I will focus on those.\n\nTherefore, only the **find_in_bed** and **flee** actions have direct preconditions related to tensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the Goldilocks story and determine the postconditions, which are changes to emotional links or tensions as a result of the action. For each action, I have to ensure that at least one postcondition is present and that if there were preconditions, the postconditions don't repeat them.\n\nLet's start by recalling what postconditions involve:\n\n1. **Emotional Links**: These can change based on the interaction between characters. If an action has a positive effect, it might create or strengthen a positive emotional link. Conversely, negative effects could lead to negative links.\n\n2. **Tensions**: Actions can introduce new tensions or resolve existing ones. Special normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` can alleviate specific tensions if they were present in preconditions.\n\nGiven the story, most actions involve Goldilocks interacting with the Bears' property, which generally has negative consequences, leading to negative emotional links. The only significant tension arises when Goldilocks flees, introducing a `life_at_risk` situation.\n\nLet's go through each action:\n\n1. **taste_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: This action likely leads to irritation from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n2. **taste_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar negative impact on emotional links.\n3. **eat_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More severe impact as she consumes all his porridge, increasing negative feelings.\n4. **sit_in_char (Great Big Bear)**: Discomfort or damage leads to frustration.\n5. **sit_in_char (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration but perhaps less intense than the Little Wee Bear's chair breaking.\n6. **sit_in_char (Little Wee Bear)**: Breaking the chair would lead to stronger negative emotions towards Goldilocks.\n7. **sleep_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Invasion of privacy leads to trust issues and negative links.\n8. **find_tampered_porridge (Great Big Bear)**: Discovery increases suspicion or anger.\n9. **find_tampered_porridge (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar reaction to the Great Big Bear.\n10. **find_tampered_porridge (Little Wee Bear)**: More upset due to the porridge being entirely eaten.\n11. **find_chair_tampered (Great Big Bear)**: Frustration increases upon finding more intrusion.\n12. **find_chair_tampered (Middle-sized Bear)**: Similar frustration as with the Great Big Bear.\n13. **find_chair_tampered (Little Wee Bear)**: Anger or disbelief at the damage done to his chair.\n14. **find_in_bed (Little Wee Bear)**: Shock and anger at finding Goldilocks, leading to stronger negative links and introducing a tension of `life_at_risk` for Goldilocks.\n15. **wake_up (Goldilocks)**: Realization of being caught leads to fear.\n16. **flee (Goldilocks)**: Escaping introduces the `life_at_risk` tension as she jumps out the window.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine how emotional links and tensions change. For example, actions where Goldilocks damages property will worsen her relationship with the Bears, while her fleeing introduces a direct risk to her life.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, so I've gone through each action in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears to ensure logical consistency. I checked that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved in each action, making sure that when there's only one character, like in 'wake_up' or 'flee', it's correctly set to 1 with appropriate references.\n\nI verified that postconditions are indeed changes from preconditions and that no dead character continues to have emotional links. Since none of the Bears die in this story, I didn't need to handle that specific case, but I kept it in mind for completeness.\n\nFor each action, I made sure there's at least one postcondition, either a change in an emotional link or a tension. For example, when Goldilocks 'flee's, it introduces a `life_at_risk` tension, which is then resolved as she escapes, though the story doesn't confirm her fate.\n\nI also ensured that all JSON keys are correctly formatted, with appropriate values for emotional links and tensions. I avoided any illogical situations where a character might have postconditions that don't make sense given their state in the story.\n\nFinally, I reviewed each action to ensure it's abstractly named without referencing specific characters, maintaining consistency across all entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\":

Alright, I need to address the issue where the actions 'wake_up' and 'flee' are missing either a subject or object. Let me go through each action to ensure that both fields are correctly populated.

First, for 'wake_up':
- The subject is Goldilocks because she's the one waking up.
- Since there's no direct interaction with another character here, perhaps the object should be '-' to indicate no other character involved.
- Therefore, n_characters should be 1.

Next, for 'flee':
- Similarly, the subject is Goldilocks as she's fleeing.
- There’s no direct object here since she’s acting alone in this action.
- So, object remains '-', and n_characters stays at 1.

I need to update these actions in the JSON to include the correct subject and object values. For 'wake_up' and 'flee', both will have Goldilocks as the subject and '-' as the object with n_characters set to 1.

Now, I'll regenerate the entire JSON object ensuring that all other actions also have appropriate subject and object values where necessary.

Story:  Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, "What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?" "I'll tell you what, husband," answered the woman, "Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them." "No, wife," said the man, "I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces." "O, thou fool!" said she, "Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins," and she left him no peace until he consented. "But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, "Now all is over with us." "Be quiet, Gretel," said Hansel, "do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us." And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, "Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us," and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying "Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood." She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, "There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else." Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, "Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs." "Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me." The wife said, "Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys." Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, "Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold." Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, "Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away."

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How are we to get out of the forest now?" But Hansel comforted her and said, "Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way." And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, "You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, "Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought "it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children." The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.

The children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, "Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us."

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. "Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?" said the father, "go on." "I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me," answered Hansel. "Simpleton!" said the woman, "that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney." Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, "Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away." When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, "Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again." When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, "We shall soon find the way," but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. "We will set to work on that," said Hansel, "and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet." Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,

"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
Who is nibbling at my little house?"

The children answered,

"The wind, the wind,
The heaven-born wind,"

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, "Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you." She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, "I have them, they shall not escape me again!" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, "That will be a dainty mouthful!" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, "Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him." Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, "Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat." Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. "Hola, Gretel," she cried to the girl, "be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him." Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! "Dear God, do help us," she cried. "If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together." "Just keep thy noise to thyself," said the old woman, "all that won't help thee at all."

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. "We will bake first," said the old woman, "I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough." She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in." And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, "I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?" "Silly goose," said the old woman, "The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, "Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. "These are far better than pebbles!" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, "I, too, will take something home with me," and filled her pinafore full. "But now we will go away." said Hansel, "that we may get out of the witch's forest."

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. "We cannot get over," said Hansel, "I see no foot-plank, and no bridge." "And no boat crosses either," answered Gretel, "but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over." Then she cried,

"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
There's never a plank, or bridge in sight,

Take us across on thy back so white."

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. "No," replied Gretel, "that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other." The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:
Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, "What is to become of us?

They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them." "No, wife," said the man, "I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces." "O, thou fool!" said she, "Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins," and she left him no peace until he consented. "But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.

They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. "We will set to work on that," said Hansel, "and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet." Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,

"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
Who is nibbling at my little house?"

The children answered,

"The wind, the wind,
The heaven-born wind,"

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, "Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you." She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, "I have them, they shall not escape me again!" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, "That will be a dainty mouthful!" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, "Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him." Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, "Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat." Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. "Hola, Gretel," she cried to the girl, "be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him." Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! "Dear God, do help us," she cried. "If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together." "Just keep thy noise to thyself," said the old woman, "all that won't help thee at all."

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. "We will bake first," said the old woman, "I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough." She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in." And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, "I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?" "Silly goose," said the old woman, "The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, "Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. "These are far better than pebbles!" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, "I, too, will take something home with me," and filled her pinafore full. "But now we will go away." said Hansel, "that we may get out of the witch's forest."

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. "We cannot get over," said Hansel, "I see no foot-plank, and no bridge." "And no boat crosses either," answered Gretel, "but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over." Then she cried,

"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
There's never a plank, or bridge in sight,

Take us across on thy back so white."

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. "No," replied Gretel, "that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other." The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

time=2025-04-15T15:54:40.045-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts.

Alright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.

First, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.

I'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. 

The story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.

Hansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.

The second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.

In captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.

Finally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.

I'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.

time=2025-04-15T15:55:30.586-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Alright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to emotional links for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.

First, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.

Starting with "face_poverty": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.

Next, "plan_abandonment" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.

Then, "gather_pebbles" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.

"Gretel weeps": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.

"Hansel comforts Gretel": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.

"Abandon_children": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).

"Hansel leaves trail": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.

"Children get lost": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.

"Find house": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).

"Witch captures them": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.

"Witch imprisons Hansel": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.

"Gretel forced to work": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.

"Gretel plans escape": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).

"Kill witch": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.

"Free Hansel": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.

"Return home": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.

So, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.

time=2025-04-15T15:56:34.960-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_abandonment\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"stepmother\",\n    \"object\": \"father\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"gather_pebbles\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"weep\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"comfort\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"abandon_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"father\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_trail\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lose_way\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"capture_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imprison\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"force_work\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_witch\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"witch\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"character_dead\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"free_hansel\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [],\n    \"postconditions\": true\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph.

The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.\n\nThen, \"gather_pebbles\" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).\n\n\"Hansel leaves trail\": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.\n\n\"Children get lost\": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.\n\n\"Find house\": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.\n\n\"Witch imprisons Hansel\": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.\n\n\"Gretel forced to work\": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.\n\n\"Gretel plans escape\": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).\n\n\"Kill witch\": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.\n\n\"Return home\": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.\n\nSo, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

Alright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to tensions for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, focusing on tensions which can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.

First, I'll go through each action one by one and identify if there's a tension that serves as a precondition for the action. Tensions are situations that create conflict or stakes in the story.

Starting with "face_poverty": This sets up the initial tension of `life_at_risk` because the family is struggling to survive, which affects all characters involved.

"Plan_abandonment" by the stepmother: The plan is driven by the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions, affecting both the father and the children.

"Gather_pebbles": Hansel's action is a response to the `health_at_risk` tension as they face starvation.

"Gretel weeps": Her emotional state is a result of the `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions affecting her.

"Hansel comforts Gretel": This action is motivated by the ongoing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.

"Abandon_children": The father's reluctance is due to the existing `life_at_risk` tension.

"Leave_trail": Hansel's precautionary measure is because of the `life_at_risk` tension.

"Lose_way": This action results from the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.

"Find_house": The children’s hope is driven by their desperation under `life_at_risk`.

"Witch captures them": The witch's malicious intent introduces `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions.

"Imprison Hansel": This action directly causes the `prisoner` tension for him.

"Force Gretel to work": Maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions.

"Plan_escape": Gretel's plan is a response to being prisoners (`prisoner`) and their lives at risk (`life_at_risk`).

"Kill_witch": This action resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions by eliminating the witch.

"Free Hansel": Removes the `prisoner` tension for him.

"Return_home": Ends all previous tensions as they return safely.

For each action, I'll determine if a tension exists that must be present for the action to occur. If so, I'll note the type of tension and which characters are involved.

time=2025-04-15T15:57:35.515-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_abandonment\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"stepmother\",\n    \"object\": \"father\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"gather_pebbles\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"weep\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"comfort\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"abandon_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"father\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_trail\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lose_way\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"capture_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imprison\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"force_work\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_witch\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"witch\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"character_dead\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"free_hansel\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [],\n    \"postconditions\": true\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to emotional links for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.\n\nThen, \"gather_pebbles\" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).\n\n\"Hansel leaves trail\": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.\n\n\"Children get lost\": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.\n\n\"Find house\": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.\n\n\"Witch imprisons Hansel\": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.\n\n\"Gretel forced to work\": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.\n\n\"Gretel plans escape\": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).\n\n\"Kill witch\": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.\n\n\"Return home\": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.\n\nSo, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, focusing on tensions which can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one and identify if there's a tension that serves as a precondition for the action. Tensions are situations that create conflict or stakes in the story.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This sets up the initial tension of `life_at_risk` because the family is struggling to survive, which affects all characters involved.\n\n\"Plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother: The plan is driven by the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions, affecting both the father and the children.\n\n\"Gather_pebbles\": Hansel's action is a response to the `health_at_risk` tension as they face starvation.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her emotional state is a result of the `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions affecting her.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": This action is motivated by the ongoing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father's reluctance is due to the existing `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Leave_trail\": Hansel's precautionary measure is because of the `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Lose_way\": This action results from the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Find_house\": The children’s hope is driven by their desperation under `life_at_risk`.\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's malicious intent introduces `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\": This action directly causes the `prisoner` tension for him.\n\n\"Force Gretel to work\": Maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Plan_escape\": Gretel's plan is a response to being prisoners (`prisoner`) and their lives at risk (`life_at_risk`).\n\n\"Kill_witch\": This action resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions by eliminating the witch.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Removes the `prisoner` tension for him.\n\n\"Return_home\": Ends all previous tensions as they return safely.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine if a tension exists that must be present for the action to occur.

Alright, I need to determine the postconditions for each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. Each action must have at least one postcondition, and if there were preconditions, the postconditions should not repeat them.

Starting with "face_poverty": This sets up initial negative emotions towards the situation but doesn't resolve any tension yet. It creates a non-romantic emotional link of magnitude -1 from the family to their circumstances.

"Plan_abandonment": The stepmother's plan increases her negative feelings towards the children, strengthening her hatred (magnitude -3). This introduces `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.

"Gather_pebbles": Hansel's action builds Gretel's trust in him, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly alleviates their `health_at_risk` tension by giving them hope.

"Gretel weeps": Her crying intensifies her fear, strengthening the negative emotional link towards the stepmother (magnitude -3). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions persist.

"Hansel comforts Gretel": Comforting strengthens their bond, creating a positive emotional link from Gretel to Hansel. This slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension as they feel supported.

"Abandon_children": The father's action increases guilt towards the children (magnitude -2) and resentment towards his wife (magnitude -1). The `life_at_risk` tension remains.

"Leave_trail": Hansel's precautionary measure builds Gretel's trust, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension due to their plan.

"Lose_way": This increases fear and mistrust in each other (magnitude -2). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions intensify.

"Find_house": Discovering the house brings hope, creating a positive emotional link (magnitude 1) towards the house. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension.

"Witch captures them": The witch's capture introduces `prisoner` and maintains `life_at_risk` tensions. Gretel develops fear (magnitude -2) towards the witch.

"Imprison Hansel": Being imprisoned increases Gretel's fear (magnitude -3) towards the witch. The `prisoner` tension is introduced for Hansel.

"Force Gretel to work": This maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions, with Gretel feeling forced into labor.

"Plan_escape": Planning their escape builds determination in Gretel, creating a positive emotional link towards Hansel. It introduces hope of resolving the `prisoner` tension.

"Kill_witch": Killing the witch resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions (using `prisoner_freed` and `life_normal`). Gretel feels relief and happiness.

"Free Hansel": This action resolves the `prisoner` tension for Hansel, using `prisoner_freed`. He feels relieved.

"Return_home": Returning home resolves all remaining tensions (`life_normal`, `health_normal`) and strengthens positive emotional links among the family.

For each action, I'll determine how it affects emotional links and tensions, ensuring that postconditions reflect these changes without repeating preconditions.

time=2025-04-15T15:59:07.859-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_abandonment\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"stepmother\",\n    \"object\": \"father\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"gather_pebbles\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"weep\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"comfort\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"abandon_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"father\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_trail\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lose_way\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"capture_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imprison\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"force_work\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_witch\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"witch\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"character_dead\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"free_hansel\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [],\n    \"postconditions\": true\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to emotional links for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.\n\nThen, \"gather_pebbles\" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).\n\n\"Hansel leaves trail\": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.\n\n\"Children get lost\": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.\n\n\"Find house\": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.\n\n\"Witch imprisons Hansel\": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.\n\n\"Gretel forced to work\": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.\n\n\"Gretel plans escape\": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).\n\n\"Kill witch\": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.\n\n\"Return home\": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.\n\nSo, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to determine the postconditions for each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. Each action must have at least one postcondition, and if there were preconditions, the postconditions should not repeat them.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This sets up initial negative emotions towards the situation but doesn't resolve any tension yet. It creates a non-romantic emotional link of magnitude -1 from the family to their circumstances.\n\n\"Plan_abandonment\": The stepmother's plan increases her negative feelings towards the children, strengthening her hatred (magnitude -3). This introduces `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Gather_pebbles\": Hansel's action builds Gretel's trust in him, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly alleviates their `health_at_risk` tension by giving them hope.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying intensifies her fear, strengthening the negative emotional link towards the stepmother (magnitude -3). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions persist.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": Comforting strengthens their bond, creating a positive emotional link from Gretel to Hansel. This slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension as they feel supported.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father's action increases guilt towards the children (magnitude -2) and resentment towards his wife (magnitude -1). The `life_at_risk` tension remains.\n\n\"Leave_trail\": Hansel's precautionary measure builds Gretel's trust, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension due to their plan.\n\n\"Lose_way\": This increases fear and mistrust in each other (magnitude -2). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions intensify.\n\n\"Find_house\": Discovering the house brings hope, creating a positive emotional link (magnitude 1) towards the house. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's capture introduces `prisoner` and maintains `life_at_risk` tensions. Gretel develops fear (magnitude -2) towards the witch.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\": Being imprisoned increases Gretel's fear (magnitude -3) towards the witch. The `prisoner` tension is introduced for Hansel.\n\n\"Force Gretel to work\": This maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions, with Gretel feeling forced into labor.\n\n\"Plan_escape\": Planning their escape builds determination in Gretel, creating a positive emotional link towards Hansel. It introduces hope of resolving the `prisoner` tension.\n\n\"Kill_witch\": Killing the witch resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions (using `prisoner_freed` and `life_normal`). Gretel feels relief and happiness.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": This action resolves the `prisoner` tension for Hansel, using `prisoner_freed`. He feels relieved.\n\n\"Return_home\": Returning home resolves all remaining tensions (`life_normal`, `health_normal`) and strengthens positive emotional links among the family.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine how it affects emotional links and tensions, ensuring that postconditions reflect these changes without repeating preconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\":

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so I need to make sure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent. That means checking that the number of characters involved matches what's in the preconditions and postconditions. Also, if a character dies, they shouldn't have any more emotional links or tensions afterwards.

First, I'll go through each action one by one. For "face_poverty", n_characters is 4 because it involves the whole family. The postcondition has an emotional link from '*' to '-', which makes sense as it's about the family feeling negatively towards their situation. Tensions are empty here, so that's okay.

Next, "plan_abandonment" has n_characters as 2 (stepmother and father). The postconditions have tensions life_at_risk and health_at_risk affecting everyone ('*'). That makes sense because planning abandonment puts the children at risk.

"Gather_pebbles" is only Hansel, so n_characters is 1. The postcondition emotional link from Gretel to Hansel with magnitude 2 seems okay. Tensions include health_normal, which slightly reduces their health risk.

Moving on, "weep" has Gretel as the subject and no object, so n_characters is 1. The postconditions show her fear towards the stepmother (magnitude -3) and maintain the tensions. That's consistent.

"Hansel comforts Gretel" involves both siblings, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel makes sense as it strengthens their bond during a tough time. Tensions include life_normal, reducing their life risk slightly.

"Abandon_children" has the father and children, so n_characters is 4. Emotional links show the father's guilt towards the children and resentment towards his wife. Tensions maintain life_at_risk, which fits as they're abandoned.

"Leave_trail" is Hansel alone, so n_characters is 1. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is positive, and tensions include life_normal, making sense as leaving a trail helps their situation.

"Lose_way" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links show mutual fear (magnitude -2), and tensions increase life_at_risk and health_at_risk, which is consistent with them being lost.

"Find_house" has both children, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link towards the house is positive (magnitude 1), reducing their life risk slightly.

"Witch captures them" involves three characters: witch and two children, so n_characters is 3. Emotional links show Gretel's fear of the witch, and tensions include prisoner and life_at_risk.

"Imprison Hansel" has the witch and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to witch is hatred (magnitude -3), fitting as she imprisons him.

"Force_work" involves the witch and Gretel, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions include prisoner and health_at_risk.

"Plan_escape" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions include prisoner_freed and life_normal, resolving some risks.

"Kill_witch" involves Gretel and the witch, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions resolve prisoner and life_at_risk.

"Free Hansel" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Hansel to Gretel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions resolve prisoner risk.

"Return_home" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links are positive among the family, resolving all tensions (life_normal and health_normal).

I need to ensure that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved in preconditions and postconditions. Also, make sure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. Each postcondition should not repeat preconditions but show a change.

Now, I'll verify each action for logical consistency, correct `n_characters`, proper use of 'a' and 'b', and ensure no illogical situations like dead characters having emotions.

time=2025-04-15T16:00:49.658-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_abandonment\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"stepmother\",\n    \"object\": \"father\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"gather_pebbles\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"weep\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"comfort\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"abandon_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"father\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_trail\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lose_way\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"capture_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imprison\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"force_work\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_witch\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"witch\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"character_dead\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"free_hansel\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [],\n    \"postconditions\": true\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to emotional links for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.\n\nThen, \"gather_pebbles\" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).\n\n\"Hansel leaves trail\": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.\n\n\"Children get lost\": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.\n\n\"Find house\": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.\n\n\"Witch imprisons Hansel\": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.\n\n\"Gretel forced to work\": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.\n\n\"Gretel plans escape\": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).\n\n\"Kill witch\": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.\n\n\"Return home\": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.\n\nSo, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to tensions for each one.

Tensions are situations that create conflict or stakes in the story.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This sets up the initial tension of `life_at_risk` because the family is struggling to survive, which affects all characters involved.\n\n\"Plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother: The plan is driven by the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions, affecting both the father and the children.\n\n\"Gather_pebbles\": Hansel's action is a response to the `health_at_risk` tension as they face starvation.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her emotional state is a result of the `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions affecting her.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": This action is motivated by the ongoing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father's reluctance is due to the existing `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Leave_trail\": Hansel's precautionary measure is because of the `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Lose_way\": This action results from the existing `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Find_house\": The children’s hope is driven by their desperation under `life_at_risk`.\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's malicious intent introduces `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\": This action directly causes the `prisoner` tension for him.\n\n\"Force Gretel to work\": Maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions.\n\n\"Plan_escape\": Gretel's plan is a response to being prisoners (`prisoner`) and their lives at risk (`life_at_risk`).\n\n\"Kill_witch\": This action resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions by eliminating the witch.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Removes the `prisoner` tension for him.\n\n\"Return_home\": Ends all previous tensions as they return safely.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine if a tension exists that must be present for the action to occur.

It slightly alleviates their `health_at_risk` tension by giving them hope.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying intensifies her fear, strengthening the negative emotional link towards the stepmother (magnitude -3). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions persist.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": Comforting strengthens their bond, creating a positive emotional link from Gretel to Hansel. This slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension as they feel supported.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father's action increases guilt towards the children (magnitude -2) and resentment towards his wife (magnitude -1). The `life_at_risk` tension remains.\n\n\"Leave_trail\": Hansel's precautionary measure builds Gretel's trust, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension due to their plan.\n\n\"Lose_way\": This increases fear and mistrust in each other (magnitude -2). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions intensify.\n\n\"Find_house\": Discovering the house brings hope, creating a positive emotional link (magnitude 1) towards the house. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's capture introduces `prisoner` and maintains `life_at_risk` tensions. Gretel develops fear (magnitude -2) towards the witch.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\": Being imprisoned increases Gretel's fear (magnitude -3) towards the witch. The `prisoner` tension is introduced for Hansel.\n\n\"Force Gretel to work\": This maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions, with Gretel feeling forced into labor.\n\n\"Plan_escape\": Planning their escape builds determination in Gretel, creating a positive emotional link towards Hansel. It introduces hope of resolving the `prisoner` tension.\n\n\"Kill_witch\": Killing the witch resolves the `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` tensions (using `prisoner_freed` and `life_normal`). Gretel feels relief and happiness.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": This action resolves the `prisoner` tension for Hansel, using `prisoner_freed`. He feels relieved.\n\n\"Return_home\": Returning home resolves all remaining tensions (`life_normal`, `health_normal`) and strengthens positive emotional links among the family.\n\nFor each action,

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to make sure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent. That means checking that the number of characters involved matches what's in the preconditions and postconditions. Also, if a character dies, they shouldn't have any more emotional links or tensions afterwards.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For \"face_poverty\", n_characters is 4 because it involves the whole family. The postcondition has an emotional link from '*' to '-', which makes sense as it's about the family feeling negatively towards their situation. Tensions are empty here, so that's okay.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" has n_characters as 2 (stepmother and father). The postconditions have tensions life_at_risk and health_at_risk affecting everyone ('*'). That makes sense because planning abandonment puts the children at risk.\n\n\"Gather_pebbles\" is only Hansel, so n_characters is 1. The postcondition emotional link from Gretel to Hansel with magnitude 2 seems okay. Tensions include health_normal, which slightly reduces their health risk.\n\nMoving on, \"weep\" has Gretel as the subject and no object, so n_characters is 1. The postconditions show her fear towards the stepmother (magnitude -3) and maintain the tensions. That's consistent.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\" involves both siblings, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel makes sense as it strengthens their bond during a tough time. Tensions include life_normal, reducing their life risk slightly.\n\n\"Abandon_children\" has the father and children, so n_characters is 4. Emotional links show the father's guilt towards the children and resentment towards his wife. Tensions maintain life_at_risk, which fits as they're abandoned.\n\n\"Leave_trail\" is Hansel alone, so n_characters is 1. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is positive, and tensions include life_normal, making sense as leaving a trail helps their situation.\n\n\"Lose_way\" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links show mutual fear (magnitude -2), and tensions increase life_at_risk and health_at_risk, which is consistent with them being lost.\n\n\"Find_house\" has both children, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link towards the house is positive (magnitude 1), reducing their life risk slightly.\n\n\"Witch captures them\" involves three characters: witch and two children, so n_characters is 3. Emotional links show Gretel's fear of the witch, and tensions include prisoner and life_at_risk.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\" has the witch and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to witch is hatred (magnitude -3), fitting as she imprisons him.\n\n\"Force_work\" involves the witch and Gretel, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions include prisoner and health_at_risk.\n\n\"Plan_escape\" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions include prisoner_freed and life_normal, resolving some risks.\n\n\"Kill_witch\" involves Gretel and the witch, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions resolve prisoner and life_at_risk.\n\n\"Free Hansel\" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Hansel to Gretel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions resolve prisoner risk.\n\n\"Return_home\" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links are positive among the family, resolving all tensions (life_normal and health_normal).\n\nI need to ensure that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved in preconditions and postconditions. Also, make sure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. Each postcondition should not repeat preconditions but show a change.\n\nNow, I'll verify each action for logical consistency, correct `n_characters`, proper use of 'a' and 'b', and ensure no illogical situations like dead characters having emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n

Alright, so I need to fix the JSON by ensuring that each action has the correct `subject` and `object` values, and adjust `n_characters` accordingly.

First, looking at "face_poverty": This is about the family facing poverty, involving all four characters. So, `subject` and `object` should be "-", but since it's a group action, `n_characters` remains 4.

Next, "gather_pebbles" involves Hansel alone, so `subject` is "Hansel", `object` is "-", and `n_characters` is 1. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel makes sense here.

"Gretel weeps": She's the one crying, so `subject` is "Gretel", `object` is "-", and `n_characters` is 1. Emotional link from her to the stepmother is correct.

"Leave_trail" is Hansel alone, same as "gather_pebbles".

"Lose_way" involves both children, so `subject` and `object` are "-", but since it's about their mutual fear, `n_characters` is 2.

"Find_house" also involves both, so similar to above.

"Return_home" has both children returning, so `subject` and `object` are "-", with `n_characters` as 2.

Now, I'll update each action accordingly.

time=2025-04-15T16:02:14.736-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"Early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—-the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"O, thou fool!\" said she, \"Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying \"Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said, \"Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—-we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought \"it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?\" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Simpleton!\" said the woman, \"that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Gretel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the room,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered,\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\nThe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, \"That will be a dainty mouthful!\" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as he liked, that was of no use. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.\" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \"Hola, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"be active, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\" Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\" \"Just keep thy noise to thyself,\" said the old woman, \"all that won't help thee at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.\" And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?\" \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\" Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \"These are far better than pebbles!\" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full. \"But now we will go away.\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water. \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\" \"And no boat crosses either,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried,\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\nTake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\" The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father's arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the story of Hansel and Gretel from a narrative perspective, focusing on emotional links between characters and tensions that build throughout the story. The user has provided specific categories for emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and types of tension (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). My task is to extract the essential actions related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully to identify key events involving Hansel, Gretel, their father, stepmother, and the witch. Since there are no romantic relationships here, all emotional links will be non-romantic, focusing on the love and loyalty between siblings and the tension with the parents, especially the stepmother.\n\nI'll start by noting each significant action, ensuring that each entry includes the action type, number of characters involved, subject, object, emotional link, tension, and whether it's preconditions or postconditions. \n\nThe story begins with the family facing poverty, leading to the stepmother convincing the father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest. This sets up initial tensions around life_at_risk because the children are left to fend for themselves. The emotional link here is non-romantic between the parents and children but turns negative due to the stepmother's malice.\n\nHansel's plan to leave breadcrumbs (pebbles) shows his proactive nature, creating a tension of health_at_risk as they face starvation. Gretel's emotional distress is another key point, highlighting their bond. When they get lost, the life_at_risk tension intensifies because they can't find their way home.\n\nThe second abandonment attempt sees Hansel unable to gather pebbles due to the locked door, so he uses breadcrumbs instead. This leads to the witch's trap when birds eat the crumbs, increasing life_at_risk and health_at_risk as they starve and become prisoners of the witch.\n\nIn captivity, Hansel is caged (prisoner), and Gretel is forced into labor, introducing prisoner tension for both. The witch's plan to eat them heightens life_at_risk. Gretel outsmarting the witch by pushing her into the oven resolves some tensions but not all until they escape.\n\nFinally, their return home brings resolution as the stepmother is dead, and they are reunited with their father. This removes the remaining tensions, leaving only non-romantic emotional links of relief and happiness.\n\nI'll structure each action in chronological order, ensuring that each entry fits the specified format without using character names, keeping actions simple. Each action must relate to either an emotional link or a tension type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_abandonment\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"stepmother\",\n    \"object\": \"father\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"gather_pebbles\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"weep\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"comfort\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"abandon_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"father\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_trail\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lose_way\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"find_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"health_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"capture_children\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"children\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imprison\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"force_work\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"witch\",\n    \"object\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"plan_escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_witch\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"witch\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"character_dead\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"free_hansel\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Gretel\",\n    \"object\": \"Hansel\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\"],\n    \"preconditions\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"non-romantic\",\n    \"tension\": [],\n    \"postconditions\": true\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze each action in the story of Hansel and Gretel and determine the preconditions related to emotional links for each one. The user has specified that preconditions are requirements that must be met for an action to make sense, especially focusing on emotional links which can have types (non-romantic or romantic) and magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each action, I need to figure out if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for the action to happen. Emotional links are directed, meaning they have a source (from) and a target (to). The magnitude indicates how strong or weak the emotion is.\n\nStarting with \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty. There's no specific emotional link here; it's more of a situational setup. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" by the stepmother towards the father: The stepmother must have some negative feelings towards the children to convince the father to abandon them. That would be a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from her to the children.\n\nThen, \"gather_pebbles\" by Hansel: Hansel's action is driven by his care for Gretel and himself. So, he has a positive emotional link towards Gretel, magnitude 3.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": Her crying stems from fear and sadness about their situation, indicating her negative feelings (magnitude -2) towards the stepmother.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": His comforting action is based on his love for her, so a non-romantic link with magnitude 3 from Hansel to Gretel.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father reluctantly abandons them because of the stepmother's influence. He must feel guilty or conflicted, so a non-romantic link towards the children with magnitude -2 (guilt) and also towards his wife with magnitude -1 (resentment).\n\n\"Hansel leaves trail\": This is about his responsibility to protect Gretel, so again a positive link from him to her.\n\n\"Children get lost\": No specific emotional links here; it's more of a result of their situation.\n\n\"Find house\": They are desperate and hopeful, which might stem from their mutual trust (non-romantic, magnitude 2).\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's action is driven by malice towards children, so non-romantic link with magnitude -3 from her to the children.\n\n\"Witch imprisons Hansel\": Same as above, directed specifically at Hansel.\n\n\"Gretel forced to work\": Witch's malice towards Gretel, same as before.\n\n\"Gretel plans escape\": Her determination is based on her love for Hansel (magnitude 3) and hatred towards the witch (magnitude -3).\n\n\"Kill witch\": Driven by Gretel's hatred (magnitude -3) towards the witch and her love (magnitude 3) for Hansel.\n\n\"Free Hansel\": Gretel's action stems from her love (magnitude 3) for him.\n\n\"Return home\": Their relief is based on their positive feelings towards each other and their father, magnitude 2.\n\nSo, I'll go through each action, determine if there are any emotional links required for the characters to perform those actions, set the type, magnitude, source, and target accordingly. If no emotional link is necessary, the preconditions will be empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions persist.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\": Comforting strengthens their bond, creating a positive emotional link from Gretel to Hansel. This slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension as they feel supported.\n\n\"Abandon_children\": The father's action increases guilt towards the children (magnitude -2) and resentment towards his wife (magnitude -1). The `life_at_risk` tension remains.\n\n\"Leave_trail\": Hansel's precautionary measure builds Gretel's trust, creating a positive emotional link. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension due to their plan.\n\n\"Lose_way\": This increases fear and mistrust in each other (magnitude -2). The `life_at_risk` and `health_at_risk` tensions intensify.\n\n\"Find_house\": Discovering the house brings hope, creating a positive emotional link (magnitude 1) towards the house. It slightly reduces the `life_at_risk` tension.\n\n\"Witch captures them\": The witch's capture introduces `prisoner` and maintains `life_at_risk` tensions. Gretel develops fear (magnitude -2) towards the witch.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\": Being imprisoned increases Gretel's fear (magnitude -3) towards the witch. The `prisoner` tension is introduced for Hansel.\n\n\"Force Gretel to work\": This maintains the `prisoner` and `health_at_risk` tensions, with Gretel feeling forced into labor.\n\n\"Plan_escape\": Planning their escape builds determination in Gretel, creating a positive emotional link towards Hansel.

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to make sure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent. That means checking that the number of characters involved matches what's in the preconditions and postconditions. Also, if a character dies, they shouldn't have any more emotional links or tensions afterwards.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For \"face_poverty\", n_characters is 4 because it involves the whole family. The postcondition has an emotional link from '*' to '-', which makes sense as it's about the family feeling negatively towards their situation. Tensions are empty here, so that's okay.\n\nNext, \"plan_abandonment\" has n_characters as 2 (stepmother and father). The postconditions have tensions life_at_risk and health_at_risk affecting everyone ('*'). That makes sense because planning abandonment puts the children at risk.\n\n\"Gather_pebbles\" is only Hansel, so n_characters is 1. The postcondition emotional link from Gretel to Hansel with magnitude 2 seems okay. Tensions include health_normal, which slightly reduces their health risk.\n\nMoving on, \"weep\" has Gretel as the subject and no object, so n_characters is 1. The postconditions show her fear towards the stepmother (magnitude -3) and maintain the tensions. That's consistent.\n\n\"Hansel comforts Gretel\" involves both siblings, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel makes sense as it strengthens their bond during a tough time. Tensions include life_normal, reducing their life risk slightly.\n\n\"Abandon_children\" has the father and children, so n_characters is 4. Emotional links show the father's guilt towards the children and resentment towards his wife. Tensions maintain life_at_risk, which fits as they're abandoned.\n\n\"Leave_trail\" is Hansel alone, so n_characters is 1. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is positive, and tensions include life_normal, making sense as leaving a trail helps their situation.\n\n\"Lose_way\" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links show mutual fear (magnitude -2), and tensions increase life_at_risk and health_at_risk, which is consistent with them being lost.\n\n\"Find_house\" has both children, so n_characters is 2. The emotional link towards the house is positive (magnitude 1), reducing their life risk slightly.\n\n\"Witch captures them\" involves three characters: witch and two children, so n_characters is 3. Emotional links show Gretel's fear of the witch, and tensions include prisoner and life_at_risk.\n\n\"Imprison Hansel\" has the witch and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to witch is hatred (magnitude -3), fitting as she imprisons him.\n\n\"Force_work\" involves the witch and Gretel, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions include prisoner and health_at_risk.\n\n\"Plan_escape\" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Gretel to Hansel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions include prisoner_freed and life_normal, resolving some risks.\n\n\"Kill_witch\" involves Gretel and the witch, so n_characters is 2. Emotional links show Gretel's hatred towards the witch, and tensions resolve prisoner and life_at_risk.\n\n\"Free Hansel\" has Gretel and Hansel, n_characters is 2. Emotional link from Hansel to Gretel is strong (magnitude 3), and tensions resolve prisoner risk.\n\n\"Return_home\" involves both children, n_characters is 2. Emotional links are positive among the family, resolving all tensions (life_normal and health_normal).\n\nI need to ensure that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved in preconditions and postconditions. Also, make sure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. Each postcondition should not repeat preconditions but show a change.\n\nNow, I'll verify each action for logical consistency, correct `n_characters`, proper use of 'a' and 'b', and ensure no illogical situations like dead characters having emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n

missing a `subject` or `object`: \n\n['face_poverty', 'gather_pebbles', 'weep', 'leave_trail', 'lose_way', 'find_house', 'return_home'].\n Please regenerate the JSON object to include the correct `subject` or `object` values for these actions and update `n_characters` appropriately. Make sure to wrap the JSON object in ```json``` tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to fix the JSON by ensuring that each action has the correct `subject` and `object` values, and adjust `n_characters` accordingly.\n\nFirst, looking at \"face_poverty\": This is about the family facing poverty, involving all four characters. So, `subject` and `object` should be \"-\", but since it's a group action, `n_characters` remains 4.\n\nNext, \"gather_pebbles\" involves Hansel alone, so `subject` is \"Hansel\", `object` is \"-\", and `n_characters` is 1. The emotional link from Gretel to Hansel makes sense here.\n\n\"Gretel weeps\": She's the one crying, so `subject` is \"Gretel\", `object` is \"-\", and `n_characters` is 1. Emotional link from her to the stepmother is correct.\n\n\"Leave_trail\" is Hansel alone, same as \"gather_pebbles\".\n\n\"Lose_way\" involves both children, so `subject` and `object` are \"-\", but since it's about their mutual fear, `n_characters` is 2.\n\n\"Find_house\" also involves both, so similar to above.\n\n\"Return_home\" has both children returning, so `subject` and `object` are \"-\", with `n_characters` as 2.\n\nNow, I'll update each action accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"face_poverty\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n
