Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

Alright, so I need to help the user by detailing how I would approach analyzing their story using narrative analysis. They provided a specific structure and types of emotional links and tensions they're interested in.

First, I'll read through the story again to make sure I understand all the key events and character interactions. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, and Huitzilopochtli. Each of them performs several actions that contribute to the emotional links and tensions.

I notice that the user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love. So, I'll need to identify moments where these relationships develop or change between characters. For example, when Princess saves Jaguar_Knight, that's a clear sign of a strong bond forming, which could be categorized under friendship or love.

Next, the tensions are specific categories like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. I'll go through each event in the story and see where these tensions apply. For instance, when Jaguar_Knight is injured on the bridge, that's health_at_risk. Later, Princess being kidnapped introduces prisoner tension, and so on.

I also need to extract actions and organize them chronologically. Each action should be concise, using snake_case, without character names. I'll make sure each JSON object includes n_characters, subject, and object, with '-' where applicable.

One thing I'm careful about is ensuring that the same action isn't repeated if it's part of a sequence. For example, Jaguar_Knight attacking Enemy involves throwing dust and stabbing, but these are separate actions even though they're part of the same fight.

I also notice that towards the end, Princess has conflicting emotions, which falls under clashing_emotions tension. Her love for Jaguar_Knight clashes with her hatred because of his tattoo, leading to tragic consequences.

Finally, I'll structure all this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions, making sure each action is properly categorized and the keys are correctly filled out.

time=2025-04-10T11:32:50.144-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user by detailing how I would approach analyzing their story using narrative analysis. They provided a specific structure and types of emotional links and tensions they're interested in.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to make sure I understand all the key events and character interactions. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, and Huitzilopochtli. Each of them performs several actions that contribute to the emotional links and tensions.\n\nI notice that the user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love. So, I'll need to identify moments where these relationships develop or change between characters. For example, when Princess saves Jaguar_Knight, that's a clear sign of a strong bond forming, which could be categorized under friendship or love.\n\nNext, the tensions are specific categories like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. I'll go through each event in the story and see where these tensions apply. For instance, when Jaguar_Knight is injured on the bridge, that's health_at_risk. Later, Princess being kidnapped introduces prisoner tension, and so on.\n\nI also need to extract actions and organize them chronologically. Each action should be concise, using snake_case, without character names.

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help with analyzing a story by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the narrative. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure this analysis, and they've also given an example response that I can refer to.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants me to go through each action in the story and determine if there are any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. A precondition means that for a character to perform an action, they must have a specific type and intensity of emotional link towards another character.

For example, if Character A attacks Character B, there might be a precondition where Character A has a negative emotional link (like hatred) towards Character B with a magnitude of -3. This would mean that Character A must feel this way towards Character B for the attack to make sense in the story.

Okay, so I need to go through each action and see if such preconditions exist based on the context provided by the story. If there are no obvious emotional links required for an action, then the precondition can be left empty or noted as not applicable.

Looking at the example response, it seems that some actions have clear emotional links, like "princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight" which obviously requires a love link with a positive magnitude. On the other hand, actions like "storm_caused_by_god" don't involve character interactions, so there are no emotional links involved.

I also need to structure each entry in JSON format as specified. Each action should have its own object with keys for `n_characters`, `subject`, `object`, and now a new key called `preconditions` which contains an array of emotional links. Each emotional link is an object with `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.

Now, let's think about each action one by one.

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This action involves the god causing a storm, but it doesn't involve any direct interaction between characters like Jaguar_Knight or Princess. So, there are no emotional links here.

2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Similar to the first action, this is an event caused by the storm damaging the bridge, not directly related to character emotions towards each other.

3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows that Jaguar_Knight was injured. It sets up the need for Princess's subsequent actions but doesn't inherently require any emotional link on its own.

4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Here, Princess is taking action to help Jaguar_Knight recover from his injury. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely friendship or love, with a significant magnitude because she went out of her way to prepare a cure.

5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Applying the plasma is an action that follows from Princess's concern for Jaguar_Knight's well-being, reinforcing the positive emotional link.

6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and shows improvement in Jaguar_Knight's condition. It doesn't require any new preconditions beyond what led to his recovery.

7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: This action introduces conflict but primarily sets up the tension rather than requiring an emotional link on its own.

8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Similar to kidnapping, this is about creating tension and doesn't inherently require preconditions based on emotional links.

9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly indicating determination or resolve, but not necessarily an emotional link towards another character.

10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: This is part of the conflict and tension but doesn't directly tie to emotional links unless considering Enemy's motivations, which might involve hatred towards Princess.

11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's motivation to search for the enemy could stem from his concern or love for Princess, indicating a positive emotional link towards her.

12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy is more about progression in the story and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link precondition.

13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation but doesn't inherently require a specific emotional link beyond the context set by previous actions.

14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Similar to throwing dust, this is part of the fight scene and follows from the established conflict without needing additional preconditions.

15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This action seems more ritualistic and doesn't necessarily tie into emotional links between characters unless considering cultural or religious motivations, which aren't specified here.

16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: This indicates Jaguar_Knight's intention to rescue Princess, suggesting a positive emotional link towards her.

17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This is a clear emotional link of type love with a high magnitude, as it's a significant development in their relationship.

18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Following from falling in love, this action requires the established love link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.

19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This moment introduces a conflict in Princess's emotions, suggesting that her positive feelings are now mixed with negative ones due to the tattoo's significance.

20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This directly relates to clashing emotions, indicating both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.

21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Odium refers to intense hatred, so this is a negative emotional link of high magnitude towards Jaguar_Knight.

22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: This action might be driven by her emotional state but doesn't directly tie to an emotional link with another character.

23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action towards Jaguar_Knight suggests a strong negative emotional link, possibly hatred.

24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: This is a result of the previous action and doesn't require its own preconditions.

25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: This tragic action indicates self-harm or suicide, driven by her internal conflict and emotional state towards Jaguar_Knight.

26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate tension in the story.

Now, putting this all together, I need to ensure that each action is analyzed for preconditions related to emotional links, structured as per the user's instructions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user by detailing how I would approach analyzing their story using narrative analysis. They provided a specific structure and types of emotional links and tensions they're interested in.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to make sure I understand all the key events and character interactions. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, and Huitzilopochtli. Each of them performs several actions that contribute to the emotional links and tensions.\n\nI notice that the user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love. So, I'll need to identify moments where these relationships develop or change between characters. For example, when Princess saves Jaguar_Knight, that's a clear sign of a strong bond forming, which could be categorized under friendship or love.\n\nNext, the tensions are specific categories like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. I'll go through each event in the story and see where these tensions apply. For instance, when Jaguar_Knight is injured on the bridge, that's health_at_risk. Later, Princess being kidnapped introduces prisoner tension, and so on.\n\nI also need to extract actions and organize them chronologically. Each action should be concise, using snake_case, without character names. I'll make sure each JSON object includes n_characters, subject, and object, with '-' where applicable.\n\nOne thing I'm careful about is ensuring that the same action isn't repeated if it's part of a sequence. For example, Jaguar_Knight attacking Enemy involves throwing dust and stabbing, but these are separate actions even though they're part of the same fight.\n\nI also notice that towards the end, Princess has conflicting emotions, which falls under clashing_emotions tension. Her love for Jaguar_Knight clashes with her hatred because of his tattoo, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nFinally, I'll structure all this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions, making sure each action is properly categorized and the keys are correctly filled out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_prepared_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applied_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped_by_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_tied_princess_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_charged_against_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_found_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blood_covered_the_floor\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_bled_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help with analyzing a story by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the narrative. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure this analysis, and they've also given an example response that I can refer to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants me to go through each action in the story and determine if there are any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. A precondition means that for a character to perform an action, they must have a specific type and intensity of emotional link towards another character.\n\nFor example, if Character A attacks Character B, there might be a precondition where Character A has a negative emotional link (like hatred) towards Character B with a magnitude of -3. This would mean that Character A must feel this way towards Character B for the attack to make sense in the story.\n\nOkay, so I need to go through each action and see if such preconditions exist based on the context provided by the story. If there are no obvious emotional links required for an action, then the precondition can be left empty or noted as not applicable.\n\nLooking at the example response, it seems that some actions have clear emotional links, like \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\" which obviously requires a love link with a positive magnitude. On the other hand, actions like \"storm_caused_by_god\" don't involve character interactions, so there are no emotional links involved.\n\nI also need to structure each entry in JSON format as specified. Each action should have its own object with keys for `n_characters`, `subject`, `object`, and now a new key called `preconditions` which contains an array of emotional links. Each emotional link is an object with `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nNow, let's think about each action one by one.\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This action involves the god causing a storm, but it doesn't involve any direct interaction between characters like Jaguar_Knight or Princess. So, there are no emotional links here.\n\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Similar to the first action, this is an event caused by the storm damaging the bridge, not directly related to character emotions towards each other.\n\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows that Jaguar_Knight was injured. It sets up the need for Princess's subsequent actions but doesn't inherently require any emotional link on its own.\n\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Here, Princess is taking action to help Jaguar_Knight recover from his injury. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely friendship or love, with a significant magnitude because she went out of her way to prepare a cure.\n\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Applying the plasma is an action that follows from Princess's concern for Jaguar_Knight's well-being, reinforcing the positive emotional link.\n\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and shows improvement in Jaguar_Knight's condition. It doesn't require any new preconditions beyond what led to his recovery.\n\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: This action introduces conflict but primarily sets up the tension rather than requiring an emotional link on its own.\n\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Similar to kidnapping, this is about creating tension and doesn't inherently require preconditions based on emotional links.\n\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly indicating determination or resolve, but not necessarily an emotional link towards another character.\n\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: This is part of the conflict and tension but doesn't directly tie to emotional links unless considering Enemy's motivations, which might involve hatred towards Princess.\n\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's motivation to search for the enemy could stem from his concern or love for Princess, indicating a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy is more about progression in the story and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link precondition.\n\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation but doesn't inherently require a specific emotional link beyond the context set by previous actions.\n\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Similar to throwing dust, this is part of the fight scene and follows from the established conflict without needing additional preconditions.\n\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This action seems more ritualistic and doesn't necessarily tie into emotional links between characters unless considering cultural or religious motivations, which aren't specified here.\n\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: This indicates Jaguar_Knight's intention to rescue Princess, suggesting a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This is a clear emotional link of type love with a high magnitude, as it's a significant development in their relationship.\n\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Following from falling in love, this action requires the established love link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This moment introduces a conflict in Princess's emotions, suggesting that her positive feelings are now mixed with negative ones due to the tattoo's significance.\n\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This directly relates to clashing emotions, indicating both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Odium refers to intense hatred, so this is a negative emotional link of high magnitude towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: This action might be driven by her emotional state but doesn't directly tie to an emotional link with another character.\n\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action towards Jaguar_Knight suggests a strong negative emotional link, possibly hatred.\n\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: This is a result of the previous action and doesn't require its own preconditions.\n\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: This tragic action indicates self-harm or suicide, driven by her internal conflict and emotional state towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate tension in the story.\n\nNow, putting this all together, I need to ensure that each action is analyzed for preconditions related to emotional links, structured as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere

Alright, I need to help with identifying preconditions related to tensions for each action in a story. The user has provided detailed instructions on how to structure this analysis, along with an example response.

First, I'll recall the types of tensions defined: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. For each action in the story, I need to determine if any of these tensions are preconditions that must exist for the action to make sense.

I'll go through each action one by one and consider what tension, if any, is required before the action can occur. If no tension is applicable, the array will be empty.

Starting with the first action:

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an event caused by a god, not directly related to character interactions, so no tensions are involved.

2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: The bridge collapsing due to the storm's damage doesn't involve any character-related tension.

3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action results in Jaguar_Knight being injured, which introduces a health risk, so `health_at_risk` applies here.

4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Princess's action to prepare the plasma is driven by Jaguar_Knight's injury, so `health_at_risk` is a precondition.

5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action is taken because of Jaguar_Knight's health risk.

6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and doesn't require any new tension precondition beyond the existing `health_at_risk`.

7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: Kidnapping introduces the `prisoner` tension as Princess is being held captive.

8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Tying her up reinforces the `prisoner` tension.

9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action doesn't directly relate to a tension but shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly due to Princess's captivity (`prisoner`).

10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: The enemy charging at Princess increases the `life_at_risk` tension for her.

11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's search is motivated by Princess being a prisoner, so `prisoner` applies here.

12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy doesn't inherently add a new tension but continues the existing `prisoner` situation.

13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation and relates to the `life_at_risk` tension for both characters involved.

14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: The stabbing increases the `life_at_risk` tension for the enemy.

15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This ritual doesn't directly tie to a specific tension unless considering symbolic risks, but it's not explicitly clear from the context provided.

16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: Walking towards Princess is part of resolving her `prisoner` status.

17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This emotional development doesn't inherently involve a tension precondition unless considering internal conflict, but it's not explicitly tied to the defined tensions.

18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Similar to falling in love, this action doesn't require a specific tension unless considering external dangers, which aren't detailed here.

19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This recognition might introduce internal conflict but not one of the defined tensions.

20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This indicates `clashing_emotions` as Princess feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.

21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Feeling odium (hatred) could lead to actions that put Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, thus introducing `life_at_risk`.

22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: Invoking a god might be due to internal emotional conflicts (`clashing_emotions`), but it's not explicitly clear.

23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action directly puts Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, so `life_at_risk` applies here.

24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: A result of the previous action and doesn't require its own tension precondition.

25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: Cutting her throat introduces `life_at_risk` for herself.

26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate `character_dead` tension.

Now, I'll structure each action with the identified tensions as per the user's instructions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user by detailing how I would approach analyzing their story using narrative analysis. They provided a specific structure and types of emotional links and tensions they're interested in.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to make sure I understand all the key events and character interactions. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, and Huitzilopochtli. Each of them performs several actions that contribute to the emotional links and tensions.\n\nI notice that the user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love. So, I'll need to identify moments where these relationships develop or change between characters. For example, when Princess saves Jaguar_Knight, that's a clear sign of a strong bond forming, which could be categorized under friendship or love.\n\nNext, the tensions are specific categories like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. I'll go through each event in the story and see where these tensions apply. For instance, when Jaguar_Knight is injured on the bridge, that's health_at_risk. Later, Princess being kidnapped introduces prisoner tension, and so on.\n\nI also need to extract actions and organize them chronologically. Each action should be concise, using snake_case, without character names. I'll make sure each JSON object includes n_characters, subject, and object, with '-' where applicable.\n\nOne thing I'm careful about is ensuring that the same action isn't repeated if it's part of a sequence. For example, Jaguar_Knight attacking Enemy involves throwing dust and stabbing, but these are separate actions even though they're part of the same fight.\n\nI also notice that towards the end, Princess has conflicting emotions, which falls under clashing_emotions tension. Her love for Jaguar_Knight clashes with her hatred because of his tattoo, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nFinally, I'll structure all this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions, making sure each action is properly categorized and the keys are correctly filled out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_prepared_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applied_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped_by_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_tied_princess_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_charged_against_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_found_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blood_covered_the_floor\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_bled_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help with analyzing a story by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the narrative. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure this analysis, and they've also given an example response that I can refer to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants me to go through each action in the story and determine if there are any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. A precondition means that for a character to perform an action, they must have a specific type and intensity of emotional link towards another character.\n\nFor example, if Character A attacks Character B, there might be a precondition where Character A has a negative emotional link (like hatred) towards Character B with a magnitude of -3. This would mean that Character A must feel this way towards Character B for the attack to make sense in the story.\n\nOkay, so I need to go through each action and see if such preconditions exist based on the context provided by the story. If there are no obvious emotional links required for an action, then the precondition can be left empty or noted as not applicable.\n\nLooking at the example response, it seems that some actions have clear emotional links, like \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\" which obviously requires a love link with a positive magnitude. On the other hand, actions like \"storm_caused_by_god\" don't involve character interactions, so there are no emotional links involved.\n\nI also need to structure each entry in JSON format as specified. Each action should have its own object with keys for `n_characters`, `subject`, `object`, and now a new key called `preconditions` which contains an array of emotional links. Each emotional link is an object with `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nNow, let's think about each action one by one.\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This action involves the god causing a storm, but it doesn't involve any direct interaction between characters like Jaguar_Knight or Princess. So, there are no emotional links here.\n\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Similar to the first action, this is an event caused by the storm damaging the bridge, not directly related to character emotions towards each other.\n\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows that Jaguar_Knight was injured. It sets up the need for Princess's subsequent actions but doesn't inherently require any emotional link on its own.\n\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Here, Princess is taking action to help Jaguar_Knight recover from his injury. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely friendship or love, with a significant magnitude because she went out of her way to prepare a cure.\n\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Applying the plasma is an action that follows from Princess's concern for Jaguar_Knight's well-being, reinforcing the positive emotional link.\n\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and shows improvement in Jaguar_Knight's condition. It doesn't require any new preconditions beyond what led to his recovery.\n\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: This action introduces conflict but primarily sets up the tension rather than requiring an emotional link on its own.\n\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Similar to kidnapping, this is about creating tension and doesn't inherently require preconditions based on emotional links.\n\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly indicating determination or resolve, but not necessarily an emotional link towards another character.\n\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: This is part of the conflict and tension but doesn't directly tie to emotional links unless considering Enemy's motivations, which might involve hatred towards Princess.\n\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's motivation to search for the enemy could stem from his concern or love for Princess, indicating a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy is more about progression in the story and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link precondition.\n\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation but doesn't inherently require a specific emotional link beyond the context set by previous actions.\n\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Similar to throwing dust, this is part of the fight scene and follows from the established conflict without needing additional preconditions.\n\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This action seems more ritualistic and doesn't necessarily tie into emotional links between characters unless considering cultural or religious motivations, which aren't specified here.\n\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: This indicates Jaguar_Knight's intention to rescue Princess, suggesting a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This is a clear emotional link of type love with a high magnitude, as it's a significant development in their relationship.\n\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Following from falling in love, this action requires the established love link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This moment introduces a conflict in Princess's emotions, suggesting that her positive feelings are now mixed with negative ones due to the tattoo's significance.\n\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This directly relates to clashing emotions, indicating both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Odium refers to intense hatred, so this is a negative emotional link of high magnitude towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: This action might be driven by her emotional state but doesn't directly tie to an emotional link with another character.\n\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action towards Jaguar_Knight suggests a strong negative emotional link, possibly hatred.\n\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: This is a result of the previous action and doesn't require its own preconditions.\n\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: This tragic action indicates self-harm or suicide, driven by her internal conflict and emotional state towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate tension in the story.\n\nNow, putting this all together, I need to ensure that each action is analyzed for preconditions related to emotional links, structured as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help with identifying preconditions related to tensions for each action in a story. The user has provided detailed instructions on how to structure this analysis, along with an example response.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the types of tensions defined: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. For each action in the story, I need to determine if any of these tensions are preconditions that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one and consider what tension, if any, is required before the action can occur. If no tension is applicable, the array will be empty.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an event caused by a god, not directly related to character interactions, so no tensions are involved.\n\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: The bridge collapsing due to the storm's damage doesn't involve any character-related tension.\n\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action results in Jaguar_Knight being injured, which introduces a health risk, so `health_at_risk` applies here.\n\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Princess's action to prepare the plasma is driven by Jaguar_Knight's injury, so `health_at_risk` is a precondition.\n\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action is taken because of Jaguar_Knight's health risk.\n\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and doesn't require any new tension precondition beyond the existing `health_at_risk`.\n\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: Kidnapping introduces the `prisoner` tension as Princess is being held captive.\n\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Tying her up reinforces the `prisoner` tension.\n\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action doesn't directly relate to a tension but shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly due to Princess's captivity (`prisoner`).\n\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: The enemy charging at Princess increases the `life_at_risk` tension for her.\n\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's search is motivated by Princess being a prisoner, so `prisoner` applies here.\n\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy doesn't inherently add a new tension but continues the existing `prisoner` situation.\n\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation and relates to the `life_at_risk` tension for both characters involved.\n\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: The stabbing increases the `life_at_risk` tension for the enemy.\n\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This ritual doesn't directly tie to a specific tension unless considering symbolic risks, but it's not explicitly clear from the context provided.\n\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: Walking towards Princess is part of resolving her `prisoner` status.\n\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This emotional development doesn't inherently involve a tension precondition unless considering internal conflict, but it's not explicitly tied to the defined tensions.\n\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Similar to falling in love, this action doesn't require a specific tension unless considering external dangers, which aren't detailed here.\n\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This recognition might introduce internal conflict but not one of the defined tensions.\n\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This indicates `clashing_emotions` as Princess feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Feeling odium (hatred) could lead to actions that put Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, thus introducing `life_at_risk`.\n\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: Invoking a god might be due to internal emotional conflicts (`clashing_emotions`), but it's not explicitly clear.\n\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action directly puts Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, so `life_at_risk` applies here.\n\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: A result of the previous action and doesn't require its own tension precondition.\n\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: Cutting her throat introduces `life_at_risk` for herself.\n\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate `character_dead` tension.\n\nNow, I'll structure each action with the identified tensions as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4.

Alright, so I'm trying to help analyze a story by identifying postconditions related to emotional links and tensions for each action. The user has provided detailed instructions on how to structure this analysis, along with examples from previous interactions.

First, I'll recall that postconditions are changes resulting from an action, affecting either emotional links or tensions. Emotional links can be positive or negative, and tensions can be introduced or resolved by actions. There's also a special set of normal tensions—`life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`—which resolve specific existing tensions.

I'll go through each action one by one, considering both the emotional impact on characters and any changes in tension states. For each action:

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This sets up a tense situation but doesn't directly affect character emotions or introduce new tensions beyond setting the stage.
2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's injury, introducing `health_at_risk` and possibly negative feelings towards the situation.
3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Establishes a health risk for Jaguar_Knight, leading to Princess's concern.
4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Shows Princess's care, developing a positive emotional link with Jaguar_Knight and aiming to resolve his `health_at_risk`.
5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Resolves the health risk, improving Jaguar_Knight's condition and strengthening their bond.
6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Confirms Jaguar_Knight's recovery, fully resolving `health_at_risk` and reinforcing positive emotions towards Princess.
7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: Introduces the `prisoner` tension for Princess and negative feelings towards the enemy.
8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Reinforces Princess's captivity and the ongoing `prisoner` tension.
9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Shows determination, possibly enhancing his resolve to rescue Princess, maintaining or intensifying positive emotional links.
10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: Increases immediate danger for Princess, heightening `life_at_risk` tension and negative feelings towards the enemy.
11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Driven by concern for Princess, maintains `prisoner` tension and positive emotional links towards her.
12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Leads to confrontation, potentially resolving `prisoner` tension but introducing `life_at_risk` as the enemy is now involved.
13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: Part of the fight, increases `life_at_risk` for both characters and negative feelings towards each other.
14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Results in the enemy's defeat, resolving `prisoner` tension as Princess is freed, but introduces `character_dead` if the enemy dies.
15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: Ritualistic action, doesn't directly resolve a tension unless it's symbolic, so no specific normal tension applies here.
16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: Approaching Princess to liberate her, aiming to resolve `prisoner` tension and strengthen positive emotional links.
17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: Develops a strong romantic bond with Jaguar_Knight, introducing a new emotional link of love.
18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Reinforces the romantic relationship, solidifying the positive emotional link established earlier.
19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Introduces internal conflict for Princess, leading to `clashing_emotions` as her feelings are now mixed.
20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: Reflects the clash between love and hatred, intensifying negative emotional links towards Jaguar_Knight.
21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Establishes a strong negative emotional link, driven by hatred due to the tattoo's significance.
22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: Driven by her emotional turmoil, possibly leading to tragic consequences and introducing `life_at_risk` for herself or Jaguar_Knight.
23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's death, introducing the `character_dead` tension and severe negative emotional impact on Princess.
24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: A result of the previous violent action, emphasizing the tragic outcome without directly introducing new tensions or emotional links.
25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: Leads to her death, resolving any remaining tensions but leaving a lasting `character_dead` state.
26. **princess_bled_to_death**: Confirms Princess's demise, finalizing the `character_dead` tension.

Now, I'll structure each action with the identified postconditions, ensuring that they follow from the actions and don't repeat preconditions unless necessary.

time=2025-04-10T11:38:52.173-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user by detailing how I would approach analyzing their story using narrative analysis. They provided a specific structure and types of emotional links and tensions they're interested in.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story again to make sure I understand all the key events and character interactions. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, and Huitzilopochtli. Each of them performs several actions that contribute to the emotional links and tensions.\n\nI notice that the user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love. So, I'll need to identify moments where these relationships develop or change between characters. For example, when Princess saves Jaguar_Knight, that's a clear sign of a strong bond forming, which could be categorized under friendship or love.\n\nNext, the tensions are specific categories like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. I'll go through each event in the story and see where these tensions apply. For instance, when Jaguar_Knight is injured on the bridge, that's health_at_risk. Later, Princess being kidnapped introduces prisoner tension, and so on.\n\nI also need to extract actions and organize them chronologically. Each action should be concise, using snake_case, without character names. I'll make sure each JSON object includes n_characters, subject, and object, with '-' where applicable.\n\nOne thing I'm careful about is ensuring that the same action isn't repeated if it's part of a sequence. For example, Jaguar_Knight attacking Enemy involves throwing dust and stabbing, but these are separate actions even though they're part of the same fight.\n\nI also notice that towards the end, Princess has conflicting emotions, which falls under clashing_emotions tension. Her love for Jaguar_Knight clashes with her hatred because of his tattoo, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nFinally, I'll structure all this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions, making sure each action is properly categorized and the keys are correctly filled out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_prepared_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applied_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped_by_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_tied_princess_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_charged_against_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_found_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blood_covered_the_floor\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_bled_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help with analyzing a story by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the narrative. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure this analysis, and they've also given an example response that I can refer to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants me to go through each action in the story and determine if there are any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. A precondition means that for a character to perform an action, they must have a specific type and intensity of emotional link towards another character.\n\nFor example, if Character A attacks Character B, there might be a precondition where Character A has a negative emotional link (like hatred) towards Character B with a magnitude of -3. This would mean that Character A must feel this way towards Character B for the attack to make sense in the story.\n\nOkay, so I need to go through each action and see if such preconditions exist based on the context provided by the story. If there are no obvious emotional links required for an action, then the precondition can be left empty or noted as not applicable.\n\nLooking at the example response, it seems that some actions have clear emotional links, like \"princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight\" which obviously requires a love link with a positive magnitude. On the other hand, actions like \"storm_caused_by_god\" don't involve character interactions, so there are no emotional links involved.\n\nI also need to structure each entry in JSON format as specified. Each action should have its own object with keys for `n_characters`, `subject`, `object`, and now a new key called `preconditions` which contains an array of emotional links. Each emotional link is an object with `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nNow, let's think about each action one by one.\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This action involves the god causing a storm, but it doesn't involve any direct interaction between characters like Jaguar_Knight or Princess. So, there are no emotional links here.\n\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Similar to the first action, this is an event caused by the storm damaging the bridge, not directly related to character emotions towards each other.\n\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows that Jaguar_Knight was injured. It sets up the need for Princess's subsequent actions but doesn't inherently require any emotional link on its own.\n\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Here, Princess is taking action to help Jaguar_Knight recover from his injury. This suggests a positive emotional link, likely friendship or love, with a significant magnitude because she went out of her way to prepare a cure.\n\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Applying the plasma is an action that follows from Princess's concern for Jaguar_Knight's well-being, reinforcing the positive emotional link.\n\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and shows improvement in Jaguar_Knight's condition. It doesn't require any new preconditions beyond what led to his recovery.\n\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: This action introduces conflict but primarily sets up the tension rather than requiring an emotional link on its own.\n\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Similar to kidnapping, this is about creating tension and doesn't inherently require preconditions based on emotional links.\n\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly indicating determination or resolve, but not necessarily an emotional link towards another character.\n\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: This is part of the conflict and tension but doesn't directly tie to emotional links unless considering Enemy's motivations, which might involve hatred towards Princess.\n\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's motivation to search for the enemy could stem from his concern or love for Princess, indicating a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy is more about progression in the story and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link precondition.\n\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation but doesn't inherently require a specific emotional link beyond the context set by previous actions.\n\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Similar to throwing dust, this is part of the fight scene and follows from the established conflict without needing additional preconditions.\n\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This action seems more ritualistic and doesn't necessarily tie into emotional links between characters unless considering cultural or religious motivations, which aren't specified here.\n\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: This indicates Jaguar_Knight's intention to rescue Princess, suggesting a positive emotional link towards her.\n\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This is a clear emotional link of type love with a high magnitude, as it's a significant development in their relationship.\n\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Following from falling in love, this action requires the established love link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This moment introduces a conflict in Princess's emotions, suggesting that her positive feelings are now mixed with negative ones due to the tattoo's significance.\n\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This directly relates to clashing emotions, indicating both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Odium refers to intense hatred, so this is a negative emotional link of high magnitude towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: This action might be driven by her emotional state but doesn't directly tie to an emotional link with another character.\n\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action towards Jaguar_Knight suggests a strong negative emotional link, possibly hatred.\n\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: This is a result of the previous action and doesn't require its own preconditions.\n\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: This tragic action indicates self-harm or suicide, driven by her internal conflict and emotional state towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate tension in the story.\n\nNow, putting this all together, I need to ensure that each action is analyzed for preconditions related to emotional links, structured as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA.

The user has provided detailed instructions on how to structure this analysis, along with an example response.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the types of tensions defined: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. For each action in the story, I need to determine if any of these tensions are preconditions that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one and consider what tension, if any, is required before the action can occur. If no tension is applicable, the array will be empty.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an event caused by a god, not directly related to character interactions, so no tensions are involved.\n\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: The bridge collapsing due to the storm's damage doesn't involve any character-related tension.\n\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action results in Jaguar_Knight being injured, which introduces a health risk, so `health_at_risk` applies here.\n\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Princess's action to prepare the plasma is driven by Jaguar_Knight's injury, so `health_at_risk` is a precondition.\n\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action is taken because of Jaguar_Knight's health risk.\n\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This is a result of Princess's actions and doesn't require any new tension precondition beyond the existing `health_at_risk`.\n\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: Kidnapping introduces the `prisoner` tension as Princess is being held captive.\n\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Tying her up reinforces the `prisoner` tension.\n\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This action doesn't directly relate to a tension but shows Jaguar_Knight seeking help, possibly due to Princess's captivity (`prisoner`).\n\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: The enemy charging at Princess increases the `life_at_risk` tension for her.\n\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's search is motivated by Princess being a prisoner, so `prisoner` applies here.\n\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Finding the enemy doesn't inherently add a new tension but continues the existing `prisoner` situation.\n\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: This action is part of the confrontation and relates to the `life_at_risk` tension for both characters involved.\n\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: The stabbing increases the `life_at_risk` tension for the enemy.\n\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: This ritual doesn't directly tie to a specific tension unless considering symbolic risks, but it's not explicitly clear from the context provided.\n\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: Walking towards Princess is part of resolving her `prisoner` status.\n\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: This emotional development doesn't inherently involve a tension precondition unless considering internal conflict, but it's not explicitly tied to the defined tensions.\n\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Similar to falling in love, this action doesn't require a specific tension unless considering external dangers, which aren't detailed here.\n\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This recognition might introduce internal conflict but not one of the defined tensions.\n\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: This indicates `clashing_emotions` as Princess feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Feeling odium (hatred) could lead to actions that put Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, thus introducing `life_at_risk`.\n\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: Invoking a god might be due to internal emotional conflicts (`clashing_emotions`), but it's not explicitly clear.\n\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: This violent action directly puts Jaguar_Knight's life at risk, so `life_at_risk` applies here.\n\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: A result of the previous action and doesn't require its own tension precondition.\n\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: Cutting her throat introduces `life_at_risk` for herself.\n\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: The consequence of her cutting her throat, highlighting the ultimate `character_dead` tension.\n\nNow, I'll structure each action with the identified tensions as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

Emotional links can be positive or negative, and tensions can be introduced or resolved by actions. There's also a special set of normal tensions—`life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`—which resolve specific existing tensions.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one, considering both the emotional impact on characters and any changes in tension states. For each action:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This sets up a tense situation but doesn't directly affect character emotions or introduce new tensions beyond setting the stage.\n2. **bridge_collapsed_due_to_damage**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's injury, introducing `health_at_risk` and possibly negative feelings towards the situation.\n3. **character_injured_head (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Establishes a health risk for Jaguar_Knight, leading to Princess's concern.\n4. **princess_prepared_curative_plasma**: Shows Princess's care, developing a positive emotional link with Jaguar_Knight and aiming to resolve his `health_at_risk`.\n5. **applied_plasma_to_wounds (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Resolves the health risk, improving Jaguar_Knight's condition and strengthening their bond.\n6. **character_recuperated (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Confirms Jaguar_Knight's recovery, fully resolving `health_at_risk` and reinforcing positive emotions towards Princess.\n7. **princess_kidnapped_by_enemy**: Introduces the `prisoner` tension for Princess and negative feelings towards the enemy.\n8. **enemy_tied_princess_to_rock**: Reinforces Princess's captivity and the ongoing `prisoner` tension.\n9. **jaguar_knight_prayed_to_god (JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Shows determination, possibly enhancing his resolve to rescue Princess, maintaining or intensifying positive emotional links.\n10. **enemy_charged_against_princess**: Increases immediate danger for Princess, heightening `life_at_risk` tension and negative feelings towards the enemy.\n11. **jaguar_knight_searched_for_enemy**: Driven by concern for Princess, maintains `prisoner` tension and positive emotional links towards her.\n12. **jaguar_knight_found_enemy**: Leads to confrontation, potentially resolving `prisoner` tension but introducing `life_at_risk` as the enemy is now involved.\n13. **jaguar_knight_threw_dust_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT to ENEMY)**: Part of the fight, increases `life_at_risk` for both characters and negative feelings towards each other.\n14. **jaguar_knight_stabbed_enemy_with_dagger**: Results in the enemy's defeat, resolving `prisoner` tension as Princess is freed, but introduces `character_dead` if the enemy dies.\n15. **jaguar_knight_performed_sacred_ceremony**: Ritualistic action, doesn't directly resolve a tension unless it's symbolic, so no specific normal tension applies here.\n16. **jaguar_knight_walked_towards_princess**: Approaching Princess to liberate her, aiming to resolve `prisoner` tension and strengthen positive emotional links.\n17. **princess_fell_in_love_with_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS)**: Develops a strong romantic bond with Jaguar_Knight, introducing a new emotional link of love.\n18. **princess_kissed_jaguar_knight**: Reinforces the romantic relationship, solidifying the positive emotional link established earlier.\n19. **princess_recognized_tattoo_on_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Introduces internal conflict for Princess, leading to `clashing_emotions` as her feelings are now mixed.\n20. **princess_had_ambivalent_thoughts_towards_jaguar_knight**: Reflects the clash between love and hatred, intensifying negative emotional links towards Jaguar_Knight.\n21. **princess_felt_odium_towards_jaguar_knight (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Establishes a strong negative emotional link, driven by hatred due to the tattoo's significance.\n22. **princess_invoked_god_of_the_dead (PRINCESS)**: Driven by her emotional turmoil, possibly leading to tragic consequences and introducing `life_at_risk` for herself or Jaguar_Knight.\n23. **princess_cut_jaguar_knight's_jugular (PRINCESS to JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's death, introducing the `character_dead` tension and severe negative emotional impact on Princess.\n24. **blood_covered_the_floor**: A result of the previous violent action, emphasizing the tragic outcome without directly introducing new tensions or emotional links.\n25. **princess_cut_own_throat (PRINCESS)**: Leads to her death, resolving any remaining tensions but leaving a lasting `character_dead` state.\n26. **princess_bled_to_death**: Confirms Princess's demise, finalizing the `character_dead` tension.\n\nNow, I'll structure each action with the identified postconditions, ensuring that they follow from the actions and don't repeat preconditions unless necessary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, I need to ensure logical consistency across all actions in the provided JSON. The user has outlined specific rules to follow, so I'll go through each action one by one.

First, I'll check if `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced. If it's 1, only 'a' should be used. For actions with two characters, both 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object) are relevant.

Next, I'll ensure that if a character dies (`character_dead`), they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. This means removing any postconditions related to dead characters.

I also need to make sure that preconditions and postconditions aren't the same. Each action should result in a change, so if a precondition is present, the postcondition must differ.

Emotional links in postconditions can't be identical to those in preconditions. I'll adjust any duplicates to ensure they reflect a change, like increasing or decreasing magnitude.

I'll verify that only 'a' and 'b' are used for emotional links and tensions. No other values should appear.

Additionally, if a character performs an action on themselves, both 'from' and 'to' can be the same ID ('a' or 'b').

I'll also ensure that normal tensions like `health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` are correctly used to resolve specific preconditions.

Finally, I'll eliminate any illogical situations, such as a dead character experiencing emotions or tensions.

Story:  Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"Does she live far off?" said the wolf

"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."

"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"

"All the better to hug you with, my dear."

"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"

"All the better to run with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.

The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

<think>
Alright, I need to analyze the given story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. 

First, I'll break down the story into key events. The main characters are Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH), her mother, grandmother, and the wolf.

The story starts with LRRH's mother showing love by making her clothes and sending her to her sick grandmother with gifts. That establishes a loving relationship between them.

Then, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. The wolf tricks her, which introduces tension because he plans to eat her. This is a life-at-risk situation.

The wolf arrives first at the grandmother's house, eats her, and disguises himself. This creates the tension of the grandmother's death and the wolf's deception.

When LRRH arrives, she interacts with the wolf (disguised as the grandmother), leading to several moments where she notices something is wrong but doesn't realize it's the wolf. Each time she comments on the "grandmother's" features, it builds tension because the reader knows the danger.

Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats LRRH, which is another life-at-risk moment and results in her death.

Now, I'll map these events into actions focusing on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions. Each action should be in snake_case without character names and include subject, object, n_characters, and the type of link or tension.

I need to ensure each JSON object only includes the specified keys and that n_characters matches the presence of subject and object.
</think>

Here is the structured analysis of the story "Little Red Riding Hood" focusing on emotional links and tensions:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "mother_shows_love",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Mother",
    "object": "Little Red Riding Hood"
  },
  {
    "action": "character_meets_predator",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "-",
    "object": "-"
  },
  {
    "action": "predator_plans_deception",
    "n_characters": 1,
    "subject": "Wolf",
    "object": "-"
  },
  {
    "action": "predator_kills_and_disguises",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Wolf",
    "object": "Grandmother"
  },
  {
    "action": "character_interacts_with_predator",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "-",
    "object": "-"
  }
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Mother Shows Love**: The mother's affection towards LRRH is evident through her actions, establishing a loving emotional link.
   
2. **Character Meets Predator**: LRRH encounters the wolf, introducing tension as her life is at risk.

3. **Predator Plans Deception**: The wolf devises a plan to trick LRRH, increasing tension with his intent to harm.

4. **Predator Kills and Disguises**: The wolf kills the grandmother, creating a character death and further tension through deception.

5. **Character Interacts with Predator**: LRRH unknowingly interacts with the disguised wolf, building suspense as she faces danger.

This analysis captures the essential emotional links and tensions in the narrative.

By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen.

I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed.

Okay, so I need to help this user by analyzing a story and extracting actions along with their preconditions related to emotional links. The story is "Little Red Riding Hood," which is pretty classic, but I want to make sure I understand all the nuances.

First, let me recap what I know about narrative analysis as it pertains to emotional links and tensions. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, each with a magnitude from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like characters being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.

So the user has already provided an initial JSON with actions related to emotional links and tensions. Now, they want me to identify preconditions for each action—specifically, the emotional links that must exist for those actions to make sense.

Alright, let's take it step by step. I need to go through each action in the JSON and determine what emotional links are necessary as preconditions.

Starting with "mother_shows_love," this action clearly involves love from the mother towards Little Red Riding Hood. So, a precondition here would be an emotional link of type 'love' with a positive magnitude.

Next, "character_meets_predator" is a bit more neutral. It’s just an encounter between LRRH and the wolf. There's no inherent emotional link here; it's more about introducing tension rather than requiring any specific emotions beforehand. So, preconditions might be empty.

Then there's "predator_plans_deception." The wolf wants to trick LRRH, so this implies some negative feelings towards her, maybe hatred or a desire to harm. This would translate to an emotional link of 'friendship' with a negative magnitude since it’s not romantic but still an intense emotion.

Moving on to "predator_kills_and_disguises," the wolf kills the grandmother and hides as her. Here, the wolf's motivation likely stems from hunger or malice, which again points to a negative emotional link towards LRRH, ensuring she doesn't suspect anything until it's too late.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator" involves LRRH talking to the disguised wolf. Since she trusts him thinking he’s her grandmother, there must be a positive emotional link of love from her towards who she believes is her grandmother, facilitating this interaction.

I need to make sure that each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotions that drive the characters' actions in the story. It's crucial to differentiate between friendship and love links and assign magnitudes based on the intensity of those emotions as portrayed in the narrative.

Also, I should format the JSON correctly, adding a 'preconditions' key with an 'emotional_links' array for each action. Each emotional link object must specify type, magnitude, from, and to.

I think that covers it. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that preconditions are appropriately identified or inferred based on the story's context.
</think>

Here is the JSON with the preconditions related to emotional links for each action:

```json

          "to": "b"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action of showing love towards Little Red Riding Hood requires a strong positive emotional link of type 'love' with magnitude 3.

2. **character_meets_predator**: There are no specific emotional links required for this neutral encounter; hence, the preconditions array is empty.

3. **predator_plans_deception**: The wolf's deceptive plan towards Little Red Riding Hood necessitates a negative emotional link of type 'friendship' with magnitude -3, indicating hatred or ill intent.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: This action by the wolf requires a similar negative emotional link towards the grandmother, facilitating his malicious actions.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Little Red Riding Hood's interaction with the disguised wolf is preconditioned on her positive emotional link of 'love' towards her grandmother, making her trust him without suspicion.

The story is \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" which is pretty classic, but I want to make sure I understand all the nuances.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about narrative analysis as it pertains to emotional links and tensions. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, each with a magnitude from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like characters being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nSo the user has already provided an initial JSON with actions related to emotional links and tensions. Now, they want me to identify preconditions for each action—specifically, the emotional links that must exist for those actions to make sense.\n\nAlright, let's take it step by step. I need to go through each action in the JSON and determine what emotional links are necessary as preconditions.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love,\" this action clearly involves love from the mother towards Little Red Riding Hood. So, a precondition here would be an emotional link of type 'love' with a positive magnitude.\n\nNext, \"character_meets_predator\" is a bit more neutral. It’s just an encounter between LRRH and the wolf. There's no inherent emotional link here; it's more about introducing tension rather than requiring any specific emotions beforehand. So, preconditions might be empty.\n\nThen there's \"predator_plans_deception.\" The wolf wants to trick LRRH, so this implies some negative feelings towards her, maybe hatred or a desire to harm. This would translate to an emotional link of 'friendship' with a negative magnitude since it’s not romantic but still an intense emotion.\n\nMoving on to \"predator_kills_and_disguises,\" the wolf kills the grandmother and hides as her. Here, the wolf's motivation likely stems from hunger or malice, which again points to a negative emotional link towards LRRH, ensuring she doesn't suspect anything until it's too late.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\" involves LRRH talking to the disguised wolf. Since she trusts him thinking he’s her grandmother, there must be a positive emotional link of love from her towards who she believes is her grandmother, facilitating this interaction.\n\nI need to make sure that each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotions that drive the characters' actions in the story. It's crucial to differentiate between friendship and love links and assign magnitudes based on the intensity of those emotions as portrayed in the narrative.\n\nAlso, I should format the JSON correctly, adding a 'preconditions' key with an 'emotional_links' array for each action. Each emotional link object must specify type, magnitude, from, and to.\n\nI think that covers it. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that preconditions are appropriately identified or inferred based on the story's context.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action of showing love towards Little Red Riding Hood requires a strong positive emotional link of type 'love' with magnitude 3.\n\n2. **character_meets_predator**: There are no specific emotional links required for this neutral encounter; hence, the preconditions array is empty.\n\n3. **predator_plans_deception**: The wolf's deceptive plan towards Little Red Riding Hood necessitates a negative emotional link of type 'friendship' with magnitude -3, indicating hatred or ill intent.\n\n4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: This action by the wolf requires a similar negative emotional link towards the grandmother, facilitating his malicious actions.\n\n5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Little Red Riding Hood's interaction with the disguised wolf is preconditioned on her positive emotional link of 'love' towards her grandmother, making her trust him without suspicion.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

<think>
Okay, so now I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Tensions can be things like a character being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.

Starting with "mother_shows_love": This action involves the mother showing affection towards LRRH. I don't see any inherent tension here because it's a positive action. So, preconditions related to tensions should be empty.

Next is "character_meets_predator": LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. This encounter introduces tension because the wolf poses a threat. Specifically, this creates a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH. The source of this tension is the wolf (object), and it affects LRRH (subject).

Moving on to "predator_plans_deception": The wolf plans to trick LRRH. This plan is driven by the existing 'life_at_risk' tension that was introduced in the previous action. So, this action requires that there's already a 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH.

Then we have "predator_kills_and_disguises": The wolf kills the grandmother and disguises as her. This action introduces two tensions: the grandmother's death ('character_dead') and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH because she's now in greater danger when she arrives. So, both of these tensions are preconditions here.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": LRRH interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This interaction is under the continued 'life_at_risk' tension as she's unaware of the danger. Additionally, since she believes it's her sick grandmother, there might be a 'health_at_risk' tension related to the grandmother's condition.

I need to make sure that for each action, I correctly identify whether any tensions must exist beforehand and specify their type, source ('from'), and target ('to'). If no tensions are required, the array remains empty.

Let me structure this into the JSON format as per instructions.

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: No tensions are present here as it's a positive interaction between the mother and LRRH.

2. **character_meets_predator**: This action introduces a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH (subject) from the wolf (object).

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Requires an existing 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH, indicating the ongoing danger she's in.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Introduces 'character_dead' for the grandmother and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH upon her arrival.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Occurs under the ongoing 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH and acknowledges the 'health_at_risk' tension due to the grandmother's illness.

By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the story into key events. The main characters are Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH), her mother, grandmother, and the wolf.\n\nThe story starts with LRRH's mother showing love by making her clothes and sending her to her sick grandmother with gifts. That establishes a loving relationship between them.\n\nThen, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. The wolf tricks her, which introduces tension because he plans to eat her. This is a life-at-risk situation.\n\nThe wolf arrives first at the grandmother's house, eats her, and disguises himself. This creates the tension of the grandmother's death and the wolf's deception.\n\nWhen LRRH arrives, she interacts with the wolf (disguised as the grandmother), leading to several moments where she notices something is wrong but doesn't realize it's the wolf. Each time she comments on the \"grandmother's\" features, it builds tension because the reader knows the danger.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats LRRH, which is another life-at-risk moment and results in her death.\n\nNow, I'll map these events into actions focusing on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions. Each action should be in snake_case without character names and include subject, object, n_characters, and the type of link or tension.\n\nI need to ensure each JSON object only includes the specified keys and that n_characters matches the presence of subject and object.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story \"Little Red Riding Hood\" focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Mother Shows Love**: The mother's affection towards LRRH is evident through her actions, establishing a loving emotional link.\n   \n2. **Character Meets Predator**: LRRH encounters the wolf, introducing tension as her life is at risk.\n\n3. **Predator Plans Deception**: The wolf devises a plan to trick LRRH, increasing tension with his intent to harm.\n\n4. **Predator Kills and Disguises**: The wolf kills the grandmother, creating a character death and further tension through deception.\n\n5. **Character Interacts with Predator**: LRRH unknowingly interacts with the disguised wolf, building suspense as she faces danger.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional links and tensions in the narrative.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help this user by analyzing a story and extracting actions along with their preconditions related to emotional links. The story is \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" which is pretty classic, but I want to make sure I understand all the nuances.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about narrative analysis as it pertains to emotional links and tensions. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, each with a magnitude from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like characters being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nSo the user has already provided an initial JSON with actions related to emotional links and tensions. Now, they want me to identify preconditions for each action—specifically, the emotional links that must exist for those actions to make sense.\n\nAlright, let's take it step by step. I need to go through each action in the JSON and determine what emotional links are necessary as preconditions.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love,\" this action clearly involves love from the mother towards Little Red Riding Hood. So, a precondition here would be an emotional link of type 'love' with a positive magnitude.\n\nNext, \"character_meets_predator\" is a bit more neutral. It’s just an encounter between LRRH and the wolf. There's no inherent emotional link here; it's more about introducing tension rather than requiring any specific emotions beforehand. So, preconditions might be empty.\n\nThen there's \"predator_plans_deception.\" The wolf wants to trick LRRH, so this implies some negative feelings towards her, maybe hatred or a desire to harm. This would translate to an emotional link of 'friendship' with a negative magnitude since it’s not romantic but still an intense emotion.\n\nMoving on to \"predator_kills_and_disguises,\" the wolf kills the grandmother and hides as her. Here, the wolf's motivation likely stems from hunger or malice, which again points to a negative emotional link towards LRRH, ensuring she doesn't suspect anything until it's too late.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\" involves LRRH talking to the disguised wolf. Since she trusts him thinking he’s her grandmother, there must be a positive emotional link of love from her towards who she believes is her grandmother, facilitating this interaction.\n\nI need to make sure that each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotions that drive the characters' actions in the story. It's crucial to differentiate between friendship and love links and assign magnitudes based on the intensity of those emotions as portrayed in the narrative.\n\nAlso, I should format the JSON correctly, adding a 'preconditions' key with an 'emotional_links' array for each action. Each emotional link object must specify type, magnitude, from, and to.\n\nI think that covers it. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that preconditions are appropriately identified or inferred based on the story's context.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action of showing love towards Little Red Riding Hood requires a strong positive emotional link of type 'love' with magnitude 3.\n\n2. **character_meets_predator**: There are no specific emotional links required for this neutral encounter; hence, the preconditions array is empty.\n\n3. **predator_plans_deception**: The wolf's deceptive plan towards Little Red Riding Hood necessitates a negative emotional link of type 'friendship' with magnitude -3, indicating hatred or ill intent.\n\n4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: This action by the wolf requires a similar negative emotional link towards the grandmother, facilitating his malicious actions.\n\n5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Little Red Riding Hood's interaction with the disguised wolf is preconditioned on her positive emotional link of 'love' towards her grandmother, making her trust him without suspicion.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Tensions can be things like a character being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love\": This action involves the mother showing affection towards LRRH. I don't see any inherent tension here because it's a positive action. So, preconditions related to tensions should be empty.\n\nNext is \"character_meets_predator\": LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. This encounter introduces tension because the wolf poses a threat. Specifically, this creates a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH. The source of this tension is the wolf (object), and it affects LRRH (subject).\n\nMoving on to \"predator_plans_deception\": The wolf plans to trick LRRH. This plan is driven by the existing 'life_at_risk' tension that was introduced in the previous action. So, this action requires that there's already a 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH.\n\nThen we have \"predator_kills_and_disguises\": The wolf kills the grandmother and disguises as her. This action introduces two tensions: the grandmother's death ('character_dead') and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH because she's now in greater danger when she arrives. So, both of these tensions are preconditions here.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\": LRRH interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This interaction is under the continued 'life_at_risk' tension as she's unaware of the danger. Additionally, since she believes it's her sick grandmother, there might be a 'health_at_risk' tension related to the grandmother's condition.\n\nI need to make sure that for each action, I correctly identify whether any tensions must exist beforehand and specify their type, source ('from'), and target ('to'). If no tensions are required, the array remains empty.\n\nLet me structure this into the JSON format as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the preconditions related to tensions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **mother_shows_love**: No tensions are present here as it's a positive interaction between the mother and LRRH.\n\n2. **character_meets_predator**: This action introduces a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH (subject) from the wolf (object).\n\n3. **predator_plans_deception**: Requires an existing 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH, indicating the ongoing danger she's in.\n\n4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Introduces 'character_dead' for the grandmother and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH upon her arrival.\n\n5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Occurs under the ongoing 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH and acknowledges the 'health_at_risk' tension due to the grandmother's illness.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions.

<think>
Alright, so now I need to identify postconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Postconditions are changes resulting from the actions—either emotional links or tensions.

Starting with "mother_shows_love": The mother's affection likely strengthens LRRH's positive feelings towards her mother. So, this would enhance their existing love link to an even higher magnitude. As for tensions, since there were none beforehand, nothing new is introduced here.

Next, "character_meets_predator": Meeting the wolf introduces fear in LRRH, creating a negative emotional link of friendship (as it's not romantic) towards the wolf. This action also heightens the tension of her life being at risk.

Then, "predator_plans_deception": The wolf's plan to trick LRRH increases her negative feelings towards him, intensifying the negative emotional link. It also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active since she’s still in danger.

Moving on to "predator_kills_and_disguises": Killing the grandmother removes any positive emotional links LRRH had with her grandmother and replaces them with grief or anger, turning it into a negative link. Additionally, this action introduces the 'character_dead' tension for the grandmother and keeps LRRH's life at risk.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": Interacting with the disguised wolf might initially maintain positive emotions from LRRH towards who she thinks is her sick grandmother. However, upon realizing the truth, it turns into fear or anger, thus creating a negative emotional link towards the wolf. This interaction also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active and introduces 'health_at_risk' for the grandmother due to her illness.

I need to ensure that each postcondition reflects changes in emotions or tensions resulting from the action, not repeating preconditions unless it's a resolution via normal tensions.

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: Reinforces the positive emotional link of love from LRRH towards her mother.

2. **character_meets_predator**: Establishes a negative friendship link from LRRH towards the wolf and maintains the life-at-risk tension.

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Maintains the existing negative emotional link and life-at-risk tension, showing no resolution yet.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Turns LRRH's love for her grandmother into grief or anger (negative link) and keeps the tensions of death and life-at-risk active.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Changes LRRH's feelings from trust to fear/anger towards the wolf, maintaining existing tensions without resolution.

This structure ensures that each action's consequences on emotional links and tensions are clearly captured in the postconditions.

time=2025-04-10T11:43:18.734-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the story into key events. The main characters are Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH), her mother, grandmother, and the wolf.\n\nThe story starts with LRRH's mother showing love by making her clothes and sending her to her sick grandmother with gifts. That establishes a loving relationship between them.\n\nThen, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. The wolf tricks her, which introduces tension because he plans to eat her. This is a life-at-risk situation.\n\nThe wolf arrives first at the grandmother's house, eats her, and disguises himself. This creates the tension of the grandmother's death and the wolf's deception.\n\nWhen LRRH arrives, she interacts with the wolf (disguised as the grandmother), leading to several moments where she notices something is wrong but doesn't realize it's the wolf. Each time she comments on the \"grandmother's\" features, it builds tension because the reader knows the danger.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats LRRH, which is another life-at-risk moment and results in her death.\n\nNow, I'll map these events into actions focusing on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions. Each action should be in snake_case without character names and include subject, object, n_characters, and the type of link or tension.\n\nI need to ensure each JSON object only includes the specified keys and that n_characters matches the presence of subject and object.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story \"Little Red Riding Hood\" focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Mother Shows Love**: The mother's affection towards LRRH is evident through her actions, establishing a loving emotional link.\n   \n2. **Character Meets Predator**: LRRH encounters the wolf, introducing tension as her life is at risk.\n\n3. **Predator Plans Deception**: The wolf devises a plan to trick LRRH, increasing tension with his intent to harm.\n\n4. **Predator Kills and Disguises**: The wolf kills the grandmother, creating a character death and further tension through deception.\n\n5. **Character Interacts with Predator**: LRRH unknowingly interacts with the disguised wolf, building suspense as she faces danger.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional links and tensions in the narrative.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help this user by analyzing a story and extracting actions along with their preconditions related to emotional links. The story is \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" which is pretty classic, but I want to make sure I understand all the nuances.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about narrative analysis as it pertains to emotional links and tensions. Emotional links can be either friendship or love, each with a magnitude from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like characters being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nSo the user has already provided an initial JSON with actions related to emotional links and tensions. Now, they want me to identify preconditions for each action—specifically, the emotional links that must exist for those actions to make sense.\n\nAlright, let's take it step by step. I need to go through each action in the JSON and determine what emotional links are necessary as preconditions.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love,\" this action clearly involves love from the mother towards Little Red Riding Hood. So, a precondition here would be an emotional link of type 'love' with a positive magnitude.\n\nNext, \"character_meets_predator\" is a bit more neutral. It’s just an encounter between LRRH and the wolf. There's no inherent emotional link here; it's more about introducing tension rather than requiring any specific emotions beforehand. So, preconditions might be empty.\n\nThen there's \"predator_plans_deception.\" The wolf wants to trick LRRH, so this implies some negative feelings towards her, maybe hatred or a desire to harm. This would translate to an emotional link of 'friendship' with a negative magnitude since it’s not romantic but still an intense emotion.\n\nMoving on to \"predator_kills_and_disguises,\" the wolf kills the grandmother and hides as her. Here, the wolf's motivation likely stems from hunger or malice, which again points to a negative emotional link towards LRRH, ensuring she doesn't suspect anything until it's too late.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\" involves LRRH talking to the disguised wolf. Since she trusts him thinking he’s her grandmother, there must be a positive emotional link of love from her towards who she believes is her grandmother, facilitating this interaction.\n\nI need to make sure that each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotions that drive the characters' actions in the story. It's crucial to differentiate between friendship and love links and assign magnitudes based on the intensity of those emotions as portrayed in the narrative.\n\nAlso, I should format the JSON correctly, adding a 'preconditions' key with an 'emotional_links' array for each action. Each emotional link object must specify type, magnitude, from, and to.\n\nI think that covers it. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that preconditions are appropriately identified or inferred based on the story's context.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action of showing love towards Little Red Riding Hood requires a strong positive emotional link of type 'love' with magnitude 3.\n\n2. **character_meets_predator**: There are no specific emotional links required for this neutral encounter; hence, the preconditions array is empty.\n\n3. **predator_plans_deception**: The wolf's deceptive plan towards Little Red Riding Hood necessitates a negative emotional link of type 'friendship' with magnitude -3, indicating hatred or ill intent.\n\n4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: This action by the wolf requires a similar negative emotional link towards the grandmother, facilitating his malicious actions.\n\n5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Little Red Riding Hood's interaction with the disguised wolf is preconditioned on her positive emotional link of 'love' towards her grandmother, making her trust him without suspicion.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA.

Tensions can be things like a character being dead, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love\": This action involves the mother showing affection towards LRRH. I don't see any inherent tension here because it's a positive action. So, preconditions related to tensions should be empty.\n\nNext is \"character_meets_predator\": LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. This encounter introduces tension because the wolf poses a threat. Specifically, this creates a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH. The source of this tension is the wolf (object), and it affects LRRH (subject).\n\nMoving on to \"predator_plans_deception\": The wolf plans to trick LRRH. This plan is driven by the existing 'life_at_risk' tension that was introduced in the previous action. So, this action requires that there's already a 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH.\n\nThen we have \"predator_kills_and_disguises\": The wolf kills the grandmother and disguises as her. This action introduces two tensions: the grandmother's death ('character_dead') and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH because she's now in greater danger when she arrives. So, both of these tensions are preconditions here.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\": LRRH interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This interaction is under the continued 'life_at_risk' tension as she's unaware of the danger. Additionally, since she believes it's her sick grandmother, there might be a 'health_at_risk' tension related to the grandmother's condition.\n\nI need to make sure that for each action, I correctly identify whether any tensions must exist beforehand and specify their type, source ('from'), and target ('to'). If no tensions are required, the array remains empty.\n\nLet me structure this into the JSON format as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the preconditions related to tensions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_shows_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_meets_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_plans_deception\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"predator_kills_and_disguises\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"Grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_interacts_with_predator\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **mother_shows_love**: No tensions are present here as it's a positive interaction between the mother and LRRH.\n\n2. **character_meets_predator**: This action introduces a 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH (subject) from the wolf (object).\n\n3. **predator_plans_deception**: Requires an existing 'life_at_risk' tension affecting LRRH, indicating the ongoing danger she's in.\n\n4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Introduces 'character_dead' for the grandmother and continues the 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH upon her arrival.\n\n5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Occurs under the ongoing 'life_at_risk' tension for LRRH and acknowledges the 'health_at_risk' tension due to the grandmother's illness.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key.

Postconditions are changes resulting from the actions—either emotional links or tensions.\n\nStarting with \"mother_shows_love\": The mother's affection likely strengthens LRRH's positive feelings towards her mother. So, this would enhance their existing love link to an even higher magnitude. As for tensions, since there were none beforehand, nothing new is introduced here.\n\nNext, \"character_meets_predator\": Meeting the wolf introduces fear in LRRH, creating a negative emotional link of friendship (as it's not romantic) towards the wolf. This action also heightens the tension of her life being at risk.\n\nThen, \"predator_plans_deception\": The wolf's plan to trick LRRH increases her negative feelings towards him, intensifying the negative emotional link. It also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active since she’s still in danger.\n\nMoving on to \"predator_kills_and_disguises\": Killing the grandmother removes any positive emotional links LRRH had with her grandmother and replaces them with grief or anger, turning it into a negative link. Additionally, this action introduces the 'character_dead' tension for the grandmother and keeps LRRH's life at risk.\n\nLastly, \"character_interacts_with_predator\": Interacting with the disguised wolf might initially maintain positive emotions from LRRH towards who she thinks is her sick grandmother. However, upon realizing the truth, it turns into fear or anger, thus creating a negative emotional link towards the wolf. This interaction also keeps the 'life_at_risk' tension active and introduces 'health_at_risk' for the grandmother due to her illness.\n\nI need to ensure that each postcondition reflects changes in emotions or tensions resulting from the action, not repeating preconditions unless it's a resolution via normal tensions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with the postconditions for each

<think>
Alright, I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying each action's details against the given constraints.

First, for "mother_shows_love": It involves two characters, mother (a) and LRRH (b). The emotional link from mother to LRRH is love with magnitude 3. In postconditions, LRRH develops a positive link towards her mother, which makes sense without introducing any tensions.

Next, "character_meets_predator" involves two characters but uses '-' for subject and object since it's a neutral encounter. However, I need to assign proper 'a' and 'b' based on the action. Here, LRRH (a) meets the wolf (b), so 'from' and 'to' should reflect this interaction. The emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf is negative friendship due to fear, and the tension is life_at_risk for LRRH.

Moving to "predator_plans_deception": Only the wolf (a) is involved, so all references should be to 'a'. The existing negative link remains, and the tension of life_at_risk continues without change.

For "predator_kills_and_disguises": Involves wolf (a) and grandmother (b). The wolf's action causes the grandmother’s death, so postconditions shouldn't have any links from her. LRRH’s emotional link turns negative towards the wolf, and tensions remain as is without introducing new ones.

Lastly, "character_interacts_with_predator": Both characters are involved, but since it's a disguised interaction, LRRH (a) interacts with the wolf (b). Her initial positive link towards her grandmother turns negative when she realizes the truth. Tensions persist without resolution yet.

I need to ensure that 'a' and 'b' correctly refer to subject and object respectively, avoid any references beyond these identifiers, and prevent deceased characters from having further emotional links or tensions.

### Explanation:

1. **mother_shows_love**: The mother's action strengthens LRRH's positive feelings, ensuring consistency with no new tensions introduced.

2. **character_meets_predator**: Correctly assigns 'a' as LRRH and 'b' as the wolf, reflecting her fear and the ongoing life-at-risk tension.

3. **predator_plans_deception**: Maintains focus on the wolf's negative emotions without introducing new emotional links or tensions.

4. **predator_kills_and_disguises**: Reflects the grandmother's death and maintains existing tensions without illogical continuations of her emotional links.

5. **character_interacts_with_predator**: Ensures LRRH's fear towards the wolf is captured, maintaining all relevant tensions without resolution.

This JSON now accurately reflects logical consistency, ensuring 'a' and 'b' correctly map to subject and object, avoiding any impossible states for deceased characters.
