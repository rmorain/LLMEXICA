Story:  Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"Does she live far off?" said the wolf

"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."

"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"

"All the better to hug you with, my dear."

"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"

"All the better to run with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more.

Okay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). 

First, the mother is very fond of her daughter and makes her cakes. That shows a strong emotional link of love. So that's an action where the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood.

Then, the mother asks her to take cake and butter to her sick grandmother. This action involves two characters, the mother and LRRH, showing both love (from the mother) and friendship or concern for the grandmother.

Next, while in the woods, LRRH meets a wolf. The wolf wants to eat her but can't because of woodcutters nearby. So this is tension: life_at_risk because she's in danger from the wolf.

The wolf asks where she's going, and she naively tells him about visiting her grandmother. This action doesn't directly involve emotional links or other specified tensions, so maybe it's not included unless it relates to gathering info that builds tension.

Then, the wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house first. He arrives, knocks, disguises his voice as LRRH, and the grandmother lets him in. The wolf eats her up, which is a character_dead event. So that's an action with the wolf as subject and grandmother as object.

The wolf then hides in bed, waiting for LRRH. When she arrives, he imitates the grandmother’s voice again. She enters and notices changes in "grandmother," which builds tension of life_at_risk because something is wrong. Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her too, another character_dead action.

So actions related to emotional links are:

1. Mother gives LRRH cake and butter (love).
2. Mother sends LRRH to grandmother (love/concern).

Tensions involved:

- life_at_risk when wolf approaches LRRH.
- prisoner? Not really, unless being eaten is considered as such, but more accurately it's character_dead.

Each action should be in JSON with subject, object, and n_characters. Let me map these out step by step.

First, mother gives items to LRRH: subject is mother, object is LRRH, n=2.

Second, mother sends her on an errand: same as above.

Third, wolf wants to eat LRRH: subject is wolf, object is LRRH, life_at_risk tension.

Fourth, wolf arrives and knocks at grandmother's house. He impersonates LRRH, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother? Or is it the action of knocking? But in JSON, actions need to relate to emotional links or tensions, so eating grandmother is key here: subject wolf, object grandmother, character_dead.

Fifth, wolf waits for LRRH and when she arrives, he speaks softly. So subject is wolf, object LRRH. She enters and notices something's wrong, leading to tension life_at_risk.

Sixth, wolf eats LRRH: subject wolf, object LRRH, character_dead.

Wait, but the story ends with both grandmother and LRRH being eaten. So two actions of character_dead.

Let me make sure each action is captured correctly.

Here's the structured JSON output capturing the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions:

time=2025-04-14T13:46:24.234-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). \n\nFirst, the mother is very fond of her daughter and makes her cakes. That shows a strong emotional link of love. So that's an action where the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThen, the mother asks her to take cake and butter to her sick grandmother. This action involves two characters, the mother and LRRH, showing both love (from the mother) and friendship or concern for the grandmother.\n\nNext, while in the woods, LRRH meets a wolf. The wolf wants to eat her but can't because of woodcutters nearby. So this is tension: life_at_risk because she's in danger from the wolf.\n\nThe wolf asks where she's going, and she naively tells him about visiting her grandmother. This action doesn't directly involve emotional links or other specified tensions, so maybe it's not included unless it relates to gathering info that builds tension.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house first. He arrives, knocks, disguises his voice as LRRH, and the grandmother lets him in. The wolf eats her up, which is a character_dead event. So that's an action with the wolf as subject and grandmother as object.\n\nThe wolf then hides in bed, waiting for LRRH. When she arrives, he imitates the grandmother’s voice again. She enters and notices changes in \"grandmother,\" which builds tension of life_at_risk because something is wrong. Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her too, another character_dead action.\n\nSo actions related to emotional links are:\n\n1. Mother gives LRRH cake and butter (love).\n2. Mother sends LRRH to grandmother (love/concern).\n\nTensions involved:\n\n- life_at_risk when wolf approaches LRRH.\n- prisoner? Not really, unless being eaten is considered as such, but more accurately it's character_dead.\n\nEach action should be in JSON with subject, object, and n_characters. Let me map these out step by step.\n\nFirst, mother gives items to LRRH: subject is mother, object is LRRH, n=2.\n\nSecond, mother sends her on an errand: same as above.\n\nThird, wolf wants to eat LRRH: subject is wolf, object is LRRH, life_at_risk tension.\n\nFourth, wolf arrives and knocks at grandmother's house. He impersonates LRRH, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother? Or is it the action of knocking? But in JSON, actions need to relate to emotional links or tensions, so eating grandmother is key here: subject wolf, object grandmother, character_dead.\n\nFifth, wolf waits for LRRH and when she arrives, he speaks softly. So subject is wolf, object LRRH. She enters and notices something's wrong, leading to tension life_at_risk.\n\nSixth, wolf eats LRRH: subject wolf, object LRRH, character_dead.\n\nWait, but the story ends with both grandmother and LRRH being eaten. So two actions of character_dead.\n\nLet me make sure each action is captured correctly.\n</think>\n\nHere's the structured JSON output capturing the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

<think>
Alright, let's dive into how I arrived at the preconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. My goal is to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions. Emotional links are categorized as either `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.

Starting with the first action, "mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter." Here, the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). This action suggests a positive emotional link of `love` because it's a caring gesture. I infer that the magnitude is 3 since the mother is described as "excessively fond" of her daughter, indicating a very strong bond.

Next, "mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother." This action also involves love, but this time directed towards the grandmother. The mother sends LRRH to visit her sick grandmother, showing concern and care for both her daughter and her mother. Hence, another `love` link with magnitude 3 from the mother to the grandmother.

Moving on to "wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood." This action is driven by hunger rather than an emotional link. The wolf's motivation isn't rooted in any positive or negative emotions towards LRRH but rather instinct. Therefore, there are no emotional links required as preconditions here.

The action "wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door" involves the wolf impersonating LRRH to gain entry. This requires some level of deceit, which might hint at a negative emotional link towards the grandmother. However, since the wolf doesn't have personal feelings against her but rather sees her as prey, there's no significant emotional link here either.

"Wolf_eats_grandmother" is a violent act driven by hunger and the desire to deceive LRRH. This action doesn't stem from any pre-existing emotional link but rather from the wolf's instincts. Hence, no emotional links are necessary for this precondition.

In "wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice," the wolf pretends to be the grandmother to lure LRRH. This deceit suggests a need to manipulate LRRH's trust. Therefore, an underlying negative emotional link of `friendship` with magnitude -3 (hatred) from the wolf towards both LRRH and the grandmother makes sense here, as it explains the wolf's intent to harm.

When "little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong," her concern for her grandmother is rooted in love. She notices changes in her 'grandmother,' indicating a strong bond of `love` with magnitude 3 towards the grandmother. This concern drives her actions and decisions next.

Lastly, "wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood" again is driven by hunger and the wolf's predatory nature rather than emotional links. Therefore, no specific emotional preconditions are needed here beyond what was established earlier.

Throughout this process, I focused on identifying moments where emotions clearly motivated a character's actions, assigning magnitudes based on the context provided in the story. This approach ensures that each precondition accurately reflects the narrative's emotional underpinnings.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). \n\nFirst, the mother is very fond of her daughter and makes her cakes. That shows a strong emotional link of love. So that's an action where the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThen, the mother asks her to take cake and butter to her sick grandmother. This action involves two characters, the mother and LRRH, showing both love (from the mother) and friendship or concern for the grandmother.\n\nNext, while in the woods, LRRH meets a wolf. The wolf wants to eat her but can't because of woodcutters nearby. So this is tension: life_at_risk because she's in danger from the wolf.\n\nThe wolf asks where she's going, and she naively tells him about visiting her grandmother. This action doesn't directly involve emotional links or other specified tensions, so maybe it's not included unless it relates to gathering info that builds tension.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house first. He arrives, knocks, disguises his voice as LRRH, and the grandmother lets him in. The wolf eats her up, which is a character_dead event. So that's an action with the wolf as subject and grandmother as object.\n\nThe wolf then hides in bed, waiting for LRRH. When she arrives, he imitates the grandmother’s voice again. She enters and notices changes in \"grandmother,\" which builds tension of life_at_risk because something is wrong. Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her too, another character_dead action.\n\nSo actions related to emotional links are:\n\n1. Mother gives LRRH cake and butter (love).\n2. Mother sends LRRH to grandmother (love/concern).\n\nTensions involved:\n\n- life_at_risk when wolf approaches LRRH.\n- prisoner? Not really, unless being eaten is considered as such, but more accurately it's character_dead.\n\nEach action should be in JSON with subject, object, and n_characters. Let me map these out step by step.\n\nFirst, mother gives items to LRRH: subject is mother, object is LRRH, n=2.\n\nSecond, mother sends her on an errand: same as above.\n\nThird, wolf wants to eat LRRH: subject is wolf, object is LRRH, life_at_risk tension.\n\nFourth, wolf arrives and knocks at grandmother's house. He impersonates LRRH, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother? Or is it the action of knocking? But in JSON, actions need to relate to emotional links or tensions, so eating grandmother is key here: subject wolf, object grandmother, character_dead.\n\nFifth, wolf waits for LRRH and when she arrives, he speaks softly. So subject is wolf, object LRRH. She enters and notices something's wrong, leading to tension life_at_risk.\n\nSixth, wolf eats LRRH: subject wolf, object LRRH, character_dead.\n\nWait, but the story ends with both grandmother and LRRH being eaten. So two actions of character_dead.\n\nLet me make sure each action is captured correctly.\n</think>\n\nHere's the structured JSON output capturing the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

My goal is to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions. Emotional links are categorized as either `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nStarting with the first action, \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" Here, the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). This action suggests a positive emotional link of `love` because it's a caring gesture. I infer that the magnitude is 3 since the mother is described as \"excessively fond\" of her daughter, indicating a very strong bond.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" This action also involves love, but this time directed towards the grandmother. The mother sends LRRH to visit her sick grandmother, showing concern and care for both her daughter and her mother. Hence, another `love` link with magnitude 3 from the mother to the grandmother.\n\nMoving on to \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood.\" This action is driven by hunger rather than an emotional link. The wolf's motivation isn't rooted in any positive or negative emotions towards LRRH but rather instinct. Therefore, there are no emotional links required as preconditions here.\n\nThe action \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\" involves the wolf impersonating LRRH to gain entry. This requires some level of deceit, which might hint at a negative emotional link towards the grandmother. However, since the wolf doesn't have personal feelings against her but rather sees her as prey, there's no significant emotional link here either.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" is a violent act driven by hunger and the desire to deceive LRRH. This action doesn't stem from any pre-existing emotional link but rather from the wolf's instincts. Hence, no emotional links are necessary for this precondition.\n\nIn \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice,\" the wolf pretends to be the grandmother to lure LRRH. This deceit suggests a need to manipulate LRRH's trust. Therefore, an underlying negative emotional link of `friendship` with magnitude -3 (hatred) from the wolf towards both LRRH and the grandmother makes sense here, as it explains the wolf's intent to harm.\n\nWhen \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong,\" her concern for her grandmother is rooted in love. She notices changes in her 'grandmother,' indicating a strong bond of `love` with magnitude 3 towards the grandmother. This concern drives her actions and decisions next.\n\nLastly, \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\" again is driven by hunger and the wolf's predatory nature rather than emotional links. Therefore, no specific emotional preconditions are needed here beyond what was established earlier.\n\nThroughout this process, I focused on identifying moments where emotions clearly motivated a character's actions, assigning magnitudes based on the context provided in the story. This approach ensures that each precondition accurately reflects the narrative's emotional underpinnings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Okay, so I need to go through each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. For each action, I'll check if there's a tension that needs to exist for the action to make sense.

Starting with the first action: "mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter." The mother is giving LRRH food. There doesn't seem to be any immediate tension here; it's just a loving gesture. So, no tensions as preconditions.

Next, "mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother." The grandmother is ill, so there's a `health_at_risk` tension involving the grandmother. This makes sense because the mother sends LRRH to check on her sick grandmother.

Then, "wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood." Here, the wolf's attempt puts LRRH's life at risk. So, the precondition is that there's a `life_at_risk` tension for LRRH caused by the wolf.

Moving on to "wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door." The wolf is pretending to be LRRH to trick the grandmother. This doesn't directly relate to any of the predefined tensions since it's more about deception than an immediate threat or risk.

"Wolf_eats_grandmother" results in her death, which falls under `character_dead`. Therefore, a precondition here would be that the wolf causes the grandmother’s death, fitting the `character_dead` tension.

In "wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice," the wolf is trying to trick LRRH into thinking he's the sick grandmother. This action doesn't directly create a new tension but relies on the existing deception. However, since there's no immediate threat or risk here, perhaps no specific tension is needed as a precondition.

When "little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong," it implies that LRRH senses danger or something amiss. This could be linked to `life_at_risk` because her realization suggests she might be in peril.

Lastly, "wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood" results in her death, which is another instance of `character_dead`. So, the precondition here is that LRRH meets this fate at the wolf's hands.

Throughout this analysis, I focused on identifying when a tension was necessary for an action to occur. For example, sending LRRH to the grandmother requires the grandmother's illness (`health_at_risk`), while actions where characters are eaten require `character_dead`.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). \n\nFirst, the mother is very fond of her daughter and makes her cakes. That shows a strong emotional link of love. So that's an action where the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThen, the mother asks her to take cake and butter to her sick grandmother. This action involves two characters, the mother and LRRH, showing both love (from the mother) and friendship or concern for the grandmother.\n\nNext, while in the woods, LRRH meets a wolf. The wolf wants to eat her but can't because of woodcutters nearby. So this is tension: life_at_risk because she's in danger from the wolf.\n\nThe wolf asks where she's going, and she naively tells him about visiting her grandmother. This action doesn't directly involve emotional links or other specified tensions, so maybe it's not included unless it relates to gathering info that builds tension.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house first. He arrives, knocks, disguises his voice as LRRH, and the grandmother lets him in. The wolf eats her up, which is a character_dead event. So that's an action with the wolf as subject and grandmother as object.\n\nThe wolf then hides in bed, waiting for LRRH. When she arrives, he imitates the grandmother’s voice again. She enters and notices changes in \"grandmother,\" which builds tension of life_at_risk because something is wrong. Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her too, another character_dead action.\n\nSo actions related to emotional links are:\n\n1. Mother gives LRRH cake and butter (love).\n2. Mother sends LRRH to grandmother (love/concern).\n\nTensions involved:\n\n- life_at_risk when wolf approaches LRRH.\n- prisoner? Not really, unless being eaten is considered as such, but more accurately it's character_dead.\n\nEach action should be in JSON with subject, object, and n_characters. Let me map these out step by step.\n\nFirst, mother gives items to LRRH: subject is mother, object is LRRH, n=2.\n\nSecond, mother sends her on an errand: same as above.\n\nThird, wolf wants to eat LRRH: subject is wolf, object is LRRH, life_at_risk tension.\n\nFourth, wolf arrives and knocks at grandmother's house. He impersonates LRRH, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother? Or is it the action of knocking? But in JSON, actions need to relate to emotional links or tensions, so eating grandmother is key here: subject wolf, object grandmother, character_dead.\n\nFifth, wolf waits for LRRH and when she arrives, he speaks softly. So subject is wolf, object LRRH. She enters and notices something's wrong, leading to tension life_at_risk.\n\nSixth, wolf eats LRRH: subject wolf, object LRRH, character_dead.\n\nWait, but the story ends with both grandmother and LRRH being eaten. So two actions of character_dead.\n\nLet me make sure each action is captured correctly.\n</think>\n\nHere's the structured JSON output capturing the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension.

My goal is to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions. Emotional links are categorized as either `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nStarting with the first action, \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" Here, the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). This action suggests a positive emotional link of `love` because it's a caring gesture. I infer that the magnitude is 3 since the mother is described as \"excessively fond\" of her daughter, indicating a very strong bond.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" This action also involves love, but this time directed towards the grandmother. The mother sends LRRH to visit her sick grandmother, showing concern and care for both her daughter and her mother. Hence, another `love` link with magnitude 3 from the mother to the grandmother.\n\nMoving on to \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood.\" This action is driven by hunger rather than an emotional link. The wolf's motivation isn't rooted in any positive or negative emotions towards LRRH but rather instinct. Therefore, there are no emotional links required as preconditions here.\n\nThe action \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\" involves the wolf impersonating LRRH to gain entry. This requires some level of deceit, which might hint at a negative emotional link towards the grandmother. However, since the wolf doesn't have personal feelings against her but rather sees her as prey, there's no significant emotional link here either.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" is a violent act driven by hunger and the desire to deceive LRRH. This action doesn't stem from any pre-existing emotional link but rather from the wolf's instincts. Hence, no emotional links are necessary for this precondition.\n\nIn \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice,\" the wolf pretends to be the grandmother to lure LRRH. This deceit suggests a need to manipulate LRRH's trust. Therefore, an underlying negative emotional link of `friendship` with magnitude -3 (hatred) from the wolf towards both LRRH and the grandmother makes sense here, as it explains the wolf's intent to harm.\n\nWhen \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong,\" her concern for her grandmother is rooted in love. She notices changes in her 'grandmother,' indicating a strong bond of `love` with magnitude 3 towards the grandmother. This concern drives her actions and decisions next.\n\nLastly, \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\" again is driven by hunger and the wolf's predatory nature rather than emotional links. Therefore, no specific emotional preconditions are needed here beyond what was established earlier.\n\nThroughout this process, I focused on identifying moments where emotions clearly motivated a character's actions, assigning magnitudes based on the context provided in the story. This approach ensures that each precondition accurately reflects the narrative's emotional underpinnings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. For each action, I'll check if there's a tension that needs to exist for the action to make sense.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" The mother is giving LRRH food. There doesn't seem to be any immediate tension here; it's just a loving gesture. So, no tensions as preconditions.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" The grandmother is ill, so there's a `health_at_risk` tension involving the grandmother. This makes sense because the mother sends LRRH to check on her sick grandmother.\n\nThen, \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood.\" Here, the wolf's attempt puts LRRH's life at risk. So, the precondition is that there's a `life_at_risk` tension for LRRH caused by the wolf.\n\nMoving on to \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door.\" The wolf is pretending to be LRRH to trick the grandmother. This doesn't directly relate to any of the predefined tensions since it's more about deception than an immediate threat or risk.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" results in her death, which falls under `character_dead`. Therefore, a precondition here would be that the wolf causes the grandmother’s death, fitting the `character_dead` tension.\n\nIn \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice,\" the wolf is trying to trick LRRH into thinking he's the sick grandmother. This action doesn't directly create a new tension but relies on the existing deception. However, since there's no immediate threat or risk here, perhaps no specific tension is needed as a precondition.\n\nWhen \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong,\" it implies that LRRH senses danger or something amiss. This could be linked to `life_at_risk` because her realization suggests she might be in peril.\n\nLastly, \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\" results in her death, which is another instance of `character_dead`. So, the precondition here is that LRRH meets this fate at the wolf's hands.\n\nThroughout this analysis, I focused on identifying when a tension was necessary for an action to occur. For example, sending LRRH to the grandmother requires the grandmother's illness (`health_at_risk`), while actions where characters are eaten require `character_dead`.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action.

These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Okay, I need to analyze each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes resulting from an action, so they must differ from any preconditions if those exist. Also, at least one postcondition is required for each action.

Starting with "mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter." This positive action likely strengthens the love between mother and LRRH. So, a new emotional link of `love` with magnitude 3 from LRRH to her mother would be a postcondition. No tension changes here since there was no prior tension.

Next, "mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother." This action is based on the grandmother's illness (`health_at_risk`). The act of sending help doesn't resolve it, but perhaps strengthens love from LRRH towards her grandmother. So, an emotional link of `love` with magnitude 3 from LRRH to grandmother is added.

"Wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood" causes fear and negative feelings towards the wolf. So, a `friendship` link with magnitude -3 from LRRH to wolf is created. The tension here increases `life_at_risk` for LRRH because of the encounter.

"Wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door" deceives the grandmother, leading her to let the wolf in. This doesn't directly affect emotional links but sets up future tensions like `character_dead`.

"Wolf_eats_grandmother" results in her death, so a postcondition is `character_dead`. No emotional link changes here as it's a negative action leading to death.

"Wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice" tricks LRRH into trusting him. This would create a negative emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf (`friendship` magnitude -3) once she realizes the deception, even though she trusts him now.

"LITTLE_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong" makes her suspicious and fearful, increasing `life_at_risk` tension for herself. This could also make her more cautious or fearful towards others.

"Wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood" results in her death (`character_dead`). Again, no emotional links here as it's a fatal action.

For each action, I need to ensure that postconditions are different from preconditions and reflect the changes accurately. Emotional links are adjusted based on positive or negative interactions, while tensions are updated to reflect new risks or resolutions.

time=2025-04-14T13:48:14.731-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). \n\nFirst, the mother is very fond of her daughter and makes her cakes. That shows a strong emotional link of love. So that's an action where the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThen, the mother asks her to take cake and butter to her sick grandmother. This action involves two characters, the mother and LRRH, showing both love (from the mother) and friendship or concern for the grandmother.\n\nNext, while in the woods, LRRH meets a wolf. The wolf wants to eat her but can't because of woodcutters nearby. So this is tension: life_at_risk because she's in danger from the wolf.\n\nThe wolf asks where she's going, and she naively tells him about visiting her grandmother. This action doesn't directly involve emotional links or other specified tensions, so maybe it's not included unless it relates to gathering info that builds tension.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house first. He arrives, knocks, disguises his voice as LRRH, and the grandmother lets him in. The wolf eats her up, which is a character_dead event. So that's an action with the wolf as subject and grandmother as object.\n\nThe wolf then hides in bed, waiting for LRRH. When she arrives, he imitates the grandmother’s voice again. She enters and notices changes in \"grandmother,\" which builds tension of life_at_risk because something is wrong. Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her too, another character_dead action.\n\nSo actions related to emotional links are:\n\n1. Mother gives LRRH cake and butter (love).\n2. Mother sends LRRH to grandmother (love/concern).\n\nTensions involved:\n\n- life_at_risk when wolf approaches LRRH.\n- prisoner? Not really, unless being eaten is considered as such, but more accurately it's character_dead.\n\nEach action should be in JSON with subject, object, and n_characters. Let me map these out step by step.\n\nFirst, mother gives items to LRRH: subject is mother, object is LRRH, n=2.\n\nSecond, mother sends her on an errand: same as above.\n\nThird, wolf wants to eat LRRH: subject is wolf, object is LRRH, life_at_risk tension.\n\nFourth, wolf arrives and knocks at grandmother's house. He impersonates LRRH, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother? Or is it the action of knocking? But in JSON, actions need to relate to emotional links or tensions, so eating grandmother is key here: subject wolf, object grandmother, character_dead.\n\nFifth, wolf waits for LRRH and when she arrives, he speaks softly. So subject is wolf, object LRRH. She enters and notices something's wrong, leading to tension life_at_risk.\n\nSixth, wolf eats LRRH: subject wolf, object LRRH, character_dead.\n\nWait, but the story ends with both grandmother and LRRH being eaten. So two actions of character_dead.\n\nLet me make sure each action is captured correctly.\n</think>\n\nHere's the structured JSON output capturing the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's dive into how I arrived at the preconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. My goal is to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions. Emotional links are categorized as either `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nStarting with the first action, \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" Here, the mother is giving something to Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). This action suggests a positive emotional link of `love` because it's a caring gesture. I infer that the magnitude is 3 since the mother is described as \"excessively fond\" of her daughter, indicating a very strong bond.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" This action also involves love, but this time directed towards the grandmother. The mother sends LRRH to visit her sick grandmother, showing concern and care for both her daughter and her mother. Hence, another `love` link with magnitude 3 from the mother to the grandmother.\n\nMoving on to \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood.\" This action is driven by hunger rather than an emotional link. The wolf's motivation isn't rooted in any positive or negative emotions towards LRRH but rather instinct. Therefore, there are no emotional links required as preconditions here.\n\nThe action \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\" involves the wolf impersonating LRRH to gain entry. This requires some level of deceit, which might hint at a negative emotional link towards the grandmother. However, since the wolf doesn't have personal feelings against her but rather sees her as prey, there's no significant emotional link here either.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" is a violent act driven by hunger and the desire to deceive LRRH. This action doesn't stem from any pre-existing emotional link but rather from the wolf's instincts. Hence, no emotional links are necessary for this precondition.\n\nIn \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice,\" the wolf pretends to be the grandmother to lure LRRH. This deceit suggests a need to manipulate LRRH's trust. Therefore, an underlying negative emotional link of `friendship` with magnitude -3 (hatred) from the wolf towards both LRRH and the grandmother makes sense here, as it explains the wolf's intent to harm.\n\nWhen \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong,\" her concern for her grandmother is rooted in love. She notices changes in her 'grandmother,' indicating a strong bond of `love` with magnitude 3 towards the grandmother. This concern drives her actions and decisions next.\n\nLastly, \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\" again is driven by hunger and the wolf's predatory nature rather than emotional links. Therefore, no specific emotional preconditions are needed here beyond what was established earlier.\n\nThroughout this process, I focused on identifying moments where emotions clearly motivated a character's actions, assigning magnitudes based on the context provided in the story.

Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. For each action, I'll check if there's a tension that needs to exist for the action to make sense.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" The mother is giving LRRH food. There doesn't seem to be any immediate tension here; it's just a loving gesture. So, no tensions as preconditions.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" The grandmother is ill, so there's a `health_at_risk` tension involving the grandmother. This makes sense because the mother sends LRRH to check on her sick grandmother.\n\nThen, \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood.\" Here, the wolf's attempt puts LRRH's life at risk. So, the precondition is that there's a `life_at_risk` tension for LRRH caused by the wolf.\n\nMoving on to \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door.\" The wolf is pretending to be LRRH to trick the grandmother. This doesn't directly relate to any of the predefined tensions since it's more about deception than an immediate threat or risk.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" results in her death, which falls under `character_dead`. Therefore, a precondition here would be that the wolf causes the grandmother’s death, fitting the `character_dead` tension.\n\nIn \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice,\" the wolf is trying to trick LRRH into thinking he's the sick grandmother. This action doesn't directly create a new tension but relies on the existing deception. However, since there's no immediate threat or risk here, perhaps no specific tension is needed as a precondition.\n\nWhen \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong,\" it implies that LRRH senses danger or something amiss. This could be linked to `life_at_risk` because her realization suggests she might be in peril.\n\nLastly, \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\" results in her death, which is another instance of `character_dead`. So, the precondition here is that LRRH meets this fate at the wolf's hands.\n\nThroughout this analysis, I focused on identifying when a tension was necessary for an action to occur. For example, sending LRRH to the grandmother requires the grandmother's illness (`health_at_risk`), while actions where characters are eaten require `character_dead`.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_eats_little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Postconditions are changes resulting from an action, so they must differ from any preconditions if those exist. Also, at least one postcondition is required for each action.\n\nStarting with \"mother_gives_little_red_riding_hood_cake_and_butter.\" This positive action likely strengthens the love between mother and LRRH. So, a new emotional link of `love` with magnitude 3 from LRRH to her mother would be a postcondition. No tension changes here since there was no prior tension.\n\nNext, \"mother_sends_little_red_riding_hood_to_grandmother.\" This action is based on the grandmother's illness (`health_at_risk`). The act of sending help doesn't resolve it, but perhaps strengthens love from LRRH towards her grandmother. So, an emotional link of `love` with magnitude 3 from LRRH to grandmother is added.\n\n\"Wolf_attempts_to_eat_little_red_riding_hood\" causes fear and negative feelings towards the wolf. So, a `friendship` link with magnitude -3 from LRRH to wolf is created. The tension here increases `life_at_risk` for LRRH because of the encounter.\n\n\"Wolf_knocks_on_grandmothers_door\" deceives the grandmother, leading her to let the wolf in. This doesn't directly affect emotional links but sets up future tensions like `character_dead`.\n\n\"Wolf_eats_grandmother\" results in her death, so a postcondition is `character_dead`. No emotional link changes here as it's a negative action leading to death.\n\n\"Wolf_imitates_grandmothers_voice\" tricks LRRH into trusting him. This would create a negative emotional link from LRRH towards the wolf (`friendship` magnitude -3) once she realizes the deception, even though she trusts him now.\n\n\"LITTLE_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong\" makes her suspicious and fearful, increasing `life_at_risk` tension for herself.

Alright, let's tackle this step by step to ensure everything is logically consistent in the JSON.

First, I'll go through each action one by one and verify that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved. For actions where only one character is involved, like "little_red_riding_hood_notices_something_wrong," I need to make sure that only 'a' is referenced in preconditions and postconditions.

Next, I'll check for any deceased characters. Once a character dies (e.g., grandmother and LRRH), they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions. So, actions involving them after their death should not reference them in postconditions.

I'll also ensure that preconditions and postconditions are different. For example, if an action has a precondition of `health_at_risk` for the grandmother, the postcondition can't be the same; it might resolve with `health_normal` or escalate to `character_dead`.

For emotional links, I need to make sure they only use 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is the subject and 'b' is the object. If an action involves self-actions, both 'from' and 'to' can be 'a'.

Tensions must also align with the characters involved. For instance, if a wolf attempts to eat LRRH, the tension should reflect that her life is at risk.

I'll remove any actions where no postcondition can be identified or inferred because each action must have at least one postcondition.

Finally, I'll validate the JSON syntax to ensure all keys are present and correctly formatted. This includes checking that numerical values are properly written without a '+' prefix.
