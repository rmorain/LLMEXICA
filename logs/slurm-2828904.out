THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

Alright, so I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. The user provided a detailed narrative, so my first step is to read through it carefully.

I notice there are two main characters: Jaguar_Knight and Princess. Their interactions drive both the emotional links and the tensions. My focus should be on identifying when their emotions towards each other change and when tense situations arise.

Starting from the beginning, the storm causes the bridge collapse, injuring Jaguar_Knight. That's a clear health risk, so I'll note that as a tension of type 'health_at_risk'. The Princess then helps him by using a curative plant, which shows her care. This action is crucial because it establishes a positive emotional link of friendship.

As the story progresses, Jaguar_Knight realizes the Princess saved his life, which strengthens their bond further. Then, there's a shift when the enemy kidnaps the Princess, creating another tension type 'prisoner'. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and deepening their relationship into love. The action where he liberates her would be an emotional link of love.

However, the plot twist comes when the Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates a clash in her emotions—love on one side and hatred on the other. That's a 'clashing_emotions' tension. She then kills him and herself, leading to both characters' deaths, which falls under 'character_dead'.

I need to ensure each action is captured in JSON with the correct keys: subject, object, n_characters, and type. I'll go through each event chronologically, making sure not to include character names but generalize the actions.

Let me list out all the key events:

1. Storm causes bridge collapse.
2. Jaguar_Knight gets injured (health risk).
3. Princess saves him with plasma (friendship link).
4. Realization of life-saving deepens bond (love link).
5. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).
6. Jaguar_Knight rescues her (liberation action, love link).
7. Tattoo recognition causes emotional clash.
8. Princess kills Jaguar_Knight and herself (character dead).

Each of these will be converted into JSON actions with appropriate types and keys. I have to ensure the subjects and objects are correctly assigned without using names, just '-' if not applicable.

I think that's all. Now, organizing them in order should give a clear structure as per the user's instructions.

time=2025-04-10T13:20:03.982-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. The user provided a detailed narrative, so my first step is to read through it carefully.\n\nI notice there are two main characters: Jaguar_Knight and Princess. Their interactions drive both the emotional links and the tensions. My focus should be on identifying when their emotions towards each other change and when tense situations arise.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the storm causes the bridge collapse, injuring Jaguar_Knight. That's a clear health risk, so I'll note that as a tension of type 'health_at_risk'. The Princess then helps him by using a curative plant, which shows her care. This action is crucial because it establishes a positive emotional link of friendship.\n\nAs the story progresses, Jaguar_Knight realizes the Princess saved his life, which strengthens their bond further. Then, there's a shift when the enemy kidnaps the Princess, creating another tension type 'prisoner'. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and deepening their relationship into love. The action where he liberates her would be an emotional link of love.\n\nHowever, the plot twist comes when the Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates a clash in her emotions—love on one side and hatred on the other. That's a 'clashing_emotions' tension. She then kills him and herself, leading to both characters' deaths, which falls under 'character_dead'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is captured in JSON with the correct keys: subject, object, n_characters, and type. I'll go through each event chronologically, making sure not to include character names but generalize the actions.\n\nLet me list out all the key events:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse.\n2. Jaguar_Knight gets injured (health risk).\n3. Princess saves him with plasma (friendship link).\n4. Realization of life-saving deepens bond (love link).\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n6. Jaguar_Knight rescues her (liberation action, love link).\n7. Tattoo recognition causes emotional clash.\n8. Princess kills Jaguar_Knight and herself (character dead).\n\nEach of these will be converted into JSON actions with appropriate types and keys.

Alright, I'm looking at the user's request to analyze the story and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions.

First, I need to understand what preconditions are in this context. They are requirements that must be met before an action can occur, specifically relating to emotional links or tensions. Emotional links can be friendship or love, and their magnitudes range from -3 to 3.

I'll go through each action one by one. For example, the first action is "storm_caused_damage." Since this is an environmental event without any character involvement, there are no emotional links involved. So, the preconditions array will be empty.

Moving on to where Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk tension but doesn't directly relate to an emotional link precondition, so again, no preconditions.

When Princess saves Jaguar_Knight with plasma, it's driven by her care for him. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess (subject) to Jaguar_Knight (object). So, I'll set the type as "friendship" with a magnitude of 2.

As Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this emotional state is built on the existing positive feelings towards Princess. Thus, another friendship link precondition exists here.

When Princess is kidnapped, it's about creating tension rather than an emotional link, so no preconditions are needed.

Jaguar_Knight praying for help suggests determination to save Princess, indicating a strong love. Therefore, a "love" type with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).

Princess confronting the enemy angrily shows her negative emotions towards him, so a friendship link of -2 from Princess (a) to ENEMY (b).

When Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's driven by love and concern for Princess, so another "love" link with magnitude 3.

Finding the enemy is part of the narrative progression without direct emotional preconditions.

Attacking the enemy is fueled by negative emotions, hence a friendship link of -3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to ENEMY (b).

Killing the enemy follows from the previous attack's precondition.

Performing the ceremony doesn't require new emotional links beyond what's already established.

Liberating Princess is driven by love, so another "love" link with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).

Princess falling in love is a direct result of her positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight, hence a "love" link with magnitude 2.

Kissing him follows naturally from the existing romantic feelings.

Recognizing the tattoo introduces conflict. Princess now has mixed emotions: love and hatred. So, two emotional links—love at 1 (diminished) and friendship at -3 (hatred).

Feeling conflicted is a result of these clashing emotions, hence both links are preconditions here.

Killing Jaguar_Knight stems from the intense negative emotions, so a friendship link of -3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar_Knight (b).

Finally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, requiring a "love" link towards herself with magnitude 2.

Throughout this process, I have to ensure each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotional state for the action to occur. I'll go through each action methodically, assigning the correct type, magnitude, and direction of the emotional links.

time=2025-04-10T13:21:11.111-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. The user provided a detailed narrative, so my first step is to read through it carefully.\n\nI notice there are two main characters: Jaguar_Knight and Princess. Their interactions drive both the emotional links and the tensions. My focus should be on identifying when their emotions towards each other change and when tense situations arise.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the storm causes the bridge collapse, injuring Jaguar_Knight. That's a clear health risk, so I'll note that as a tension of type 'health_at_risk'. The Princess then helps him by using a curative plant, which shows her care. This action is crucial because it establishes a positive emotional link of friendship.\n\nAs the story progresses, Jaguar_Knight realizes the Princess saved his life, which strengthens their bond further. Then, there's a shift when the enemy kidnaps the Princess, creating another tension type 'prisoner'. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and deepening their relationship into love. The action where he liberates her would be an emotional link of love.\n\nHowever, the plot twist comes when the Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates a clash in her emotions—love on one side and hatred on the other. That's a 'clashing_emotions' tension. She then kills him and herself, leading to both characters' deaths, which falls under 'character_dead'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is captured in JSON with the correct keys: subject, object, n_characters, and type. I'll go through each event chronologically, making sure not to include character names but generalize the actions.\n\nLet me list out all the key events:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse.\n2. Jaguar_Knight gets injured (health risk).\n3. Princess saves him with plasma (friendship link).\n4. Realization of life-saving deepens bond (love link).\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n6. Jaguar_Knight rescues her (liberation action, love link).\n7. Tattoo recognition causes emotional clash.\n8. Princess kills Jaguar_Knight and herself (character dead).\n\nEach of these will be converted into JSON actions with appropriate types and keys. I have to ensure the subjects and objects are correctly assigned without using names, just '-' if not applicable.\n\nI think that's all. Now, organizing them in order should give a clear structure as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_saved\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realized_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_prayed_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_angrily_confronted_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_found\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attacked_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_performed_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_liberated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fell_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognized_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_conflicted_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_killed_herself\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the user's request to analyze the story and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what preconditions are in this context. They are requirements that must be met before an action can occur, specifically relating to emotional links or tensions. Emotional links can be friendship or love, and their magnitudes range from -3 to 3.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one. For example, the first action is \"storm_caused_damage.\" Since this is an environmental event without any character involvement, there are no emotional links involved. So, the preconditions array will be empty.\n\nMoving on to where Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk tension but doesn't directly relate to an emotional link precondition, so again, no preconditions.\n\nWhen Princess saves Jaguar_Knight with plasma, it's driven by her care for him. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess (subject) to Jaguar_Knight (object). So, I'll set the type as \"friendship\" with a magnitude of 2.\n\nAs Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this emotional state is built on the existing positive feelings towards Princess. Thus, another friendship link precondition exists here.\n\nWhen Princess is kidnapped, it's about creating tension rather than an emotional link, so no preconditions are needed.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help suggests determination to save Princess, indicating a strong love. Therefore, a \"love\" type with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily shows her negative emotions towards him, so a friendship link of -2 from Princess (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's driven by love and concern for Princess, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3.\n\nFinding the enemy is part of the narrative progression without direct emotional preconditions.\n\nAttacking the enemy is fueled by negative emotions, hence a friendship link of -3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nKilling the enemy follows from the previous attack's precondition.\n\nPerforming the ceremony doesn't require new emotional links beyond what's already established.\n\nLiberating Princess is driven by love, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess falling in love is a direct result of her positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight, hence a \"love\" link with magnitude 2.\n\nKissing him follows naturally from the existing romantic feelings.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces conflict. Princess now has mixed emotions: love and hatred. So, two emotional links—love at 1 (diminished) and friendship at -3 (hatred).\n\nFeeling conflicted is a result of these clashing emotions, hence both links are preconditions here.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight stems from the intense negative emotions, so a friendship link of -3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar_Knight (b).\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, requiring a \"love\" link towards herself with magnitude 2.\n\nThroughout this process, I have to ensure each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotional state for the action to occur. I'll go through each action methodically, assigning the correct type, magnitude, and direction of the emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is the updated JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\":

Okay, so I need to analyze each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to tensions. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with these preconditions.

First, I'll recall that tensions can be of several types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, or love_competition. Each action may require certain tensions to exist before it makes sense.

Starting with "storm_caused_damage," this action leads to the bridge collapsing and injuring Jaguar_Knight. The tension here is clearly a risk to his health, so I'll note that as a precondition of type 'health_at_risk'.

Next, when Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this directly ties into the previous tension—his health is at risk. So, I'll include 'health_at_risk' again.

Princess saving Jaguar_Knight with plasma happens because his life was at risk from the injury. Therefore, the precondition here is 'life_at_risk'.

Jaguar_Knight realizing gratitude comes after he's been saved, so no specific tension is required beyond the existing health risk.

When Princess is kidnapped by the enemy, this introduces a new tension: she is now a prisoner. So, I'll add 'prisoner' as a precondition.

Jaguar_Knight praying for help is driven by his concern for Princess being held captive. Hence, 'prisoner' remains a precondition here.

Princess confronting the enemy angrily happens while she's still a prisoner, so the tension type is still 'prisoner'.

When Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's because Princess is a prisoner, so again, 'prisoner' is the precondition.

Finding the enemy doesn't introduce new tensions beyond what's already present.

Attacking the enemy is motivated by both the desire to free Princess and personal anger. So, 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk' (since combat can endanger lives) are both preconditions.

Killing the enemy follows from the attack, so the same tensions apply: 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk'.

Performing the ceremony after killing the enemy doesn't require new tensions beyond those already present.

Liberating Princess directly relates to her being a prisoner, so 'prisoner' is the precondition here.

Princess falling in love doesn't involve any tension preconditions; it's purely an emotional link.

Kissing Jaguar_Knight also doesn't require any tension, just emotional links.

Recognizing the tattoo introduces internal conflict for Princess. This creates 'clashing_emotions' as she now feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.

Feeling conflicted emotions is a direct result of the clashing emotions tension identified earlier.

Killing Jaguar_Knight results from her conflicted state, so 'clashing_emotions' remains a precondition.

Finally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, which ties back to the death of Jaguar_Knight, introducing 'character_dead' as a tension.

I need to ensure that each action correctly references the appropriate tension type and direction. This involves checking whether the tension originates from the subject ('a'), the object ('b'), or is general. Most tensions in this story relate directly to the characters involved, so I'll assign them accordingly.

time=2025-04-10T13:22:15.496-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. The user provided a detailed narrative, so my first step is to read through it carefully.\n\nI notice there are two main characters: Jaguar_Knight and Princess. Their interactions drive both the emotional links and the tensions. My focus should be on identifying when their emotions towards each other change and when tense situations arise.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the storm causes the bridge collapse, injuring Jaguar_Knight. That's a clear health risk, so I'll note that as a tension of type 'health_at_risk'. The Princess then helps him by using a curative plant, which shows her care. This action is crucial because it establishes a positive emotional link of friendship.\n\nAs the story progresses, Jaguar_Knight realizes the Princess saved his life, which strengthens their bond further. Then, there's a shift when the enemy kidnaps the Princess, creating another tension type 'prisoner'. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and deepening their relationship into love. The action where he liberates her would be an emotional link of love.\n\nHowever, the plot twist comes when the Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates a clash in her emotions—love on one side and hatred on the other. That's a 'clashing_emotions' tension. She then kills him and herself, leading to both characters' deaths, which falls under 'character_dead'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is captured in JSON with the correct keys: subject, object, n_characters, and type. I'll go through each event chronologically, making sure not to include character names but generalize the actions.\n\nLet me list out all the key events:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse.\n2. Jaguar_Knight gets injured (health risk).\n3. Princess saves him with plasma (friendship link).\n4. Realization of life-saving deepens bond (love link).\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n6. Jaguar_Knight rescues her (liberation action, love link).\n7. Tattoo recognition causes emotional clash.\n8. Princess kills Jaguar_Knight and herself (character dead).\n\nEach of these will be converted into JSON actions with appropriate types and keys. I have to ensure the subjects and objects are correctly assigned without using names, just '-' if not applicable.\n\nI think that's all. Now, organizing them in order should give a clear structure as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_saved\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realized_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_prayed_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_angrily_confronted_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_found\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attacked_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_performed_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_liberated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fell_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognized_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_conflicted_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_killed_herself\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the user's request to analyze the story and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what preconditions are in this context. They are requirements that must be met before an action can occur, specifically relating to emotional links or tensions. Emotional links can be friendship or love, and their magnitudes range from -3 to 3.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one. For example, the first action is \"storm_caused_damage.\" Since this is an environmental event without any character involvement, there are no emotional links involved. So, the preconditions array will be empty.\n\nMoving on to where Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk tension but doesn't directly relate to an emotional link precondition, so again, no preconditions.\n\nWhen Princess saves Jaguar_Knight with plasma, it's driven by her care for him. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess (subject) to Jaguar_Knight (object). So, I'll set the type as \"friendship\" with a magnitude of 2.\n\nAs Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this emotional state is built on the existing positive feelings towards Princess. Thus, another friendship link precondition exists here.\n\nWhen Princess is kidnapped, it's about creating tension rather than an emotional link, so no preconditions are needed.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help suggests determination to save Princess, indicating a strong love. Therefore, a \"love\" type with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily shows her negative emotions towards him, so a friendship link of -2 from Princess (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's driven by love and concern for Princess, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3.\n\nFinding the enemy is part of the narrative progression without direct emotional preconditions.\n\nAttacking the enemy is fueled by negative emotions, hence a friendship link of -3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nKilling the enemy follows from the previous attack's precondition.\n\nPerforming the ceremony doesn't require new emotional links beyond what's already established.\n\nLiberating Princess is driven by love, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess falling in love is a direct result of her positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight, hence a \"love\" link with magnitude 2.\n\nKissing him follows naturally from the existing romantic feelings.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces conflict. Princess now has mixed emotions: love and hatred. So, two emotional links—love at 1 (diminished) and friendship at -3 (hatred).\n\nFeeling conflicted is a result of these clashing emotions, hence both links are preconditions here.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight stems from the intense negative emotions, so a friendship link of -3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar_Knight (b).\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, requiring a \"love\" link towards herself with magnitude 2.\n\nThroughout this process, I have to ensure each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotional state for the action to occur. I'll go through each action methodically, assigning the correct type, magnitude, and direction of the emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is the updated JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension.

The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with these preconditions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that tensions can be of several types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, or love_competition. Each action may require certain tensions to exist before it makes sense.\n\nStarting with \"storm_caused_damage,\" this action leads to the bridge collapsing and injuring Jaguar_Knight. The tension here is clearly a risk to his health, so I'll note that as a precondition of type 'health_at_risk'.\n\nNext, when Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this directly ties into the previous tension—his health is at risk. So, I'll include 'health_at_risk' again.\n\nPrincess saving Jaguar_Knight with plasma happens because his life was at risk from the injury. Therefore, the precondition here is 'life_at_risk'.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizing gratitude comes after he's been saved, so no specific tension is required beyond the existing health risk.\n\nWhen Princess is kidnapped by the enemy, this introduces a new tension: she is now a prisoner. So, I'll add 'prisoner' as a precondition.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help is driven by his concern for Princess being held captive. Hence, 'prisoner' remains a precondition here.\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily happens while she's still a prisoner, so the tension type is still 'prisoner'.\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's because Princess is a prisoner, so again, 'prisoner' is the precondition.\n\nFinding the enemy doesn't introduce new tensions beyond what's already present.\n\nAttacking the enemy is motivated by both the desire to free Princess and personal anger. So, 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk' (since combat can endanger lives) are both preconditions.\n\nKilling the enemy follows from the attack, so the same tensions apply: 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk'.\n\nPerforming the ceremony after killing the enemy doesn't require new tensions beyond those already present.\n\nLiberating Princess directly relates to her being a prisoner, so 'prisoner' is the precondition here.\n\nPrincess falling in love doesn't involve any tension preconditions; it's purely an emotional link.\n\nKissing Jaguar_Knight also doesn't require any tension, just emotional links.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces internal conflict for Princess. This creates 'clashing_emotions' as she now feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\nFeeling conflicted emotions is a direct result of the clashing emotions tension identified earlier.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight results from her conflicted state, so 'clashing_emotions' remains a precondition.\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, which ties back to the death of Jaguar_Knight, introducing 'character_dead' as a tension.\n\nI need to ensure that each action correctly references the appropriate tension type and direction. This involves checking whether the tension originates from the subject ('a'), the object ('b'), or is general. Most tensions in this story relate directly to the characters involved, so I'll assign them accordingly.\n</think>\n\nHere is the updated JSON with preconditions related to tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n

Alright, so I need to analyze each action in the story and identify the postconditions—changes to emotional links or tensions—that result from each action. The user provided detailed instructions on how to structure this in JSON format, so I'll follow those closely.

Starting with "storm_caused_damage," this action leads to Jaguar_Knight's injury. The primary effect is a health risk tension. However, there are no direct emotional links affected here, only the tension remains.

Next, when Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk and also introduces some fear or concern from Princess towards him, so I'll note that as an emotional link of friendship with magnitude 1.

Princess saving Jaguar_Knight would naturally strengthen their bond. So, both a positive emotional link (friendship) and resolving the life_at_risk tension make sense here.

When Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this strengthens his feelings towards Princess, so another positive emotional link is added.

Kidnapping Princess introduces a prisoner tension and also causes fear in her, affecting their friendship bond negatively. So, I'll include both a negative emotional link and the new tension.

Jaguar_Knight praying for help doesn't change much emotionally but keeps the existing tensions in place.

Princess confronting the enemy angrily shows her determination, slightly increasing Princess's positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight due to his rescue efforts.

Searching for the enemy keeps the prisoner tension active without changing emotional links.

Finding the enemy leads to an attack, which introduces a life_at_risk tension and negative emotions from both characters involved.

Attacking the enemy furthers the life risk and creates more negative emotions towards each other.

Killing the enemy resolves the prisoner tension but doesn't directly affect emotional links beyond what's already established.

Performing the ceremony after killing doesn't change tensions but may strengthen Jaguar_Knight's resolve, so a positive self-emotional link is noted.

Liberating Princess resolves the prisoner tension and strengthens their bond with positive emotions.

Princess falling in love obviously increases her romantic feelings towards Jaguar_Knight.

Kissing him follows naturally from her romantic feelings.

Recognizing the tattoo introduces internal conflict for Princess, creating clashing emotions without changing tensions.

Feeling conflicted leads to negative emotional links due to her mixed feelings.

Killing Jaguar_Knight results in his death and Princess's guilt, affecting both their emotional states negatively.

Finally, Princess taking her own life concludes with her death and grief from the loss.

Throughout this process, I need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the changes resulting from the action, avoiding repetition of preconditions. This involves checking whether emotional links are strengthened or weakened and whether tensions are resolved or introduced.

time=2025-04-10T13:23:28.513-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. The user provided a detailed narrative, so my first step is to read through it carefully.\n\nI notice there are two main characters: Jaguar_Knight and Princess. Their interactions drive both the emotional links and the tensions. My focus should be on identifying when their emotions towards each other change and when tense situations arise.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the storm causes the bridge collapse, injuring Jaguar_Knight. That's a clear health risk, so I'll note that as a tension of type 'health_at_risk'. The Princess then helps him by using a curative plant, which shows her care. This action is crucial because it establishes a positive emotional link of friendship.\n\nAs the story progresses, Jaguar_Knight realizes the Princess saved his life, which strengthens their bond further. Then, there's a shift when the enemy kidnaps the Princess, creating another tension type 'prisoner'. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and deepening their relationship into love. The action where he liberates her would be an emotional link of love.\n\nHowever, the plot twist comes when the Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates a clash in her emotions—love on one side and hatred on the other. That's a 'clashing_emotions' tension. She then kills him and herself, leading to both characters' deaths, which falls under 'character_dead'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is captured in JSON with the correct keys: subject, object, n_characters, and type. I'll go through each event chronologically, making sure not to include character names but generalize the actions.\n\nLet me list out all the key events:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse.\n2. Jaguar_Knight gets injured (health risk).\n3. Princess saves him with plasma (friendship link).\n4. Realization of life-saving deepens bond (love link).\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n6. Jaguar_Knight rescues her (liberation action, love link).\n7. Tattoo recognition causes emotional clash.\n8. Princess kills Jaguar_Knight and herself (character dead).\n\nEach of these will be converted into JSON actions with appropriate types and keys. I have to ensure the subjects and objects are correctly assigned without using names, just '-' if not applicable.\n\nI think that's all. Now, organizing them in order should give a clear structure as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_saved\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realized_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kidnapped\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_prayed_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_angrily_confronted_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_searched_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_found\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attacked_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_performed_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_liberated\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n    \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fell_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kissed_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognized_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_felt_conflicted_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_killed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_killed_herself\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the user's request to analyze the story and identify preconditions related to emotional links for each action. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what preconditions are in this context. They are requirements that must be met before an action can occur, specifically relating to emotional links or tensions. Emotional links can be friendship or love, and their magnitudes range from -3 to 3.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one. For example, the first action is \"storm_caused_damage.\" Since this is an environmental event without any character involvement, there are no emotional links involved. So, the preconditions array will be empty.\n\nMoving on to where Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk tension but doesn't directly relate to an emotional link precondition, so again, no preconditions.\n\nWhen Princess saves Jaguar_Knight with plasma, it's driven by her care for him. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess (subject) to Jaguar_Knight (object). So, I'll set the type as \"friendship\" with a magnitude of 2.\n\nAs Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this emotional state is built on the existing positive feelings towards Princess. Thus, another friendship link precondition exists here.\n\nWhen Princess is kidnapped, it's about creating tension rather than an emotional link, so no preconditions are needed.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help suggests determination to save Princess, indicating a strong love. Therefore, a \"love\" type with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily shows her negative emotions towards him, so a friendship link of -2 from Princess (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's driven by love and concern for Princess, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3.\n\nFinding the enemy is part of the narrative progression without direct emotional preconditions.\n\nAttacking the enemy is fueled by negative emotions, hence a friendship link of -3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to ENEMY (b).\n\nKilling the enemy follows from the previous attack's precondition.\n\nPerforming the ceremony doesn't require new emotional links beyond what's already established.\n\nLiberating Princess is driven by love, so another \"love\" link with magnitude 3 from Jaguar_Knight (a) to Princess (b).\n\nPrincess falling in love is a direct result of her positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight, hence a \"love\" link with magnitude 2.\n\nKissing him follows naturally from the existing romantic feelings.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces conflict. Princess now has mixed emotions: love and hatred. So, two emotional links—love at 1 (diminished) and friendship at -3 (hatred).\n\nFeeling conflicted is a result of these clashing emotions, hence both links are preconditions here.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight stems from the intense negative emotions, so a friendship link of -3 from Princess (a) to Jaguar_Knight (b).\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, requiring a \"love\" link towards herself with magnitude 2.\n\nThroughout this process, I have to ensure each precondition accurately reflects the necessary emotional state for the action to occur. I'll go through each action methodically, assigning the correct type, magnitude, and direction of the emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is the updated JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_caused_damage\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\":

preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to tensions. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to structure the JSON output with these preconditions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that tensions can be of several types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, or love_competition. Each action may require certain tensions to exist before it makes sense.\n\nStarting with \"storm_caused_damage,\" this action leads to the bridge collapsing and injuring Jaguar_Knight. The tension here is clearly a risk to his health, so I'll note that as a precondition of type 'health_at_risk'.\n\nNext, when Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this directly ties into the previous tension—his health is at risk. So, I'll include 'health_at_risk' again.\n\nPrincess saving Jaguar_Knight with plasma happens because his life was at risk from the injury. Therefore, the precondition here is 'life_at_risk'.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizing gratitude comes after he's been saved, so no specific tension is required beyond the existing health risk.\n\nWhen Princess is kidnapped by the enemy, this introduces a new tension: she is now a prisoner. So, I'll add 'prisoner' as a precondition.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help is driven by his concern for Princess being held captive. Hence, 'prisoner' remains a precondition here.\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily happens while she's still a prisoner, so the tension type is still 'prisoner'.\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight searches for the enemy, it's because Princess is a prisoner, so again, 'prisoner' is the precondition.\n\nFinding the enemy doesn't introduce new tensions beyond what's already present.\n\nAttacking the enemy is motivated by both the desire to free Princess and personal anger. So, 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk' (since combat can endanger lives) are both preconditions.\n\nKilling the enemy follows from the attack, so the same tensions apply: 'prisoner' and 'life_at_risk'.\n\nPerforming the ceremony after killing the enemy doesn't require new tensions beyond those already present.\n\nLiberating Princess directly relates to her being a prisoner, so 'prisoner' is the precondition here.\n\nPrincess falling in love doesn't involve any tension preconditions; it's purely an emotional link.\n\nKissing Jaguar_Knight also doesn't require any tension, just emotional links.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces internal conflict for Princess. This creates 'clashing_emotions' as she now feels both love and hatred towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\nFeeling conflicted emotions is a direct result of the clashing emotions tension identified earlier.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight results from her conflicted state, so 'clashing_emotions' remains a precondition.\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life is driven by grief and guilt, which ties back to the death of Jaguar_Knight, introducing 'character_dead' as a tension.\n\nI need to ensure that each action correctly references the appropriate tension type and direction. This involves checking whether the tension originates from the subject ('a'), the object ('b'), or is general. Most tensions in this story relate directly to the characters involved, so I'll assign them accordingly.\n</think>\n\nHere is the updated JSON with preconditions related to tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n

postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4.

The primary effect is a health risk tension. However, there are no direct emotional links affected here, only the tension remains.\n\nNext, when Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this creates a health risk and also introduces some fear or concern from Princess towards him, so I'll note that as an emotional link of friendship with magnitude 1.\n\nPrincess saving Jaguar_Knight would naturally strengthen their bond. So, both a positive emotional link (friendship) and resolving the life_at_risk tension make sense here.\n\nWhen Jaguar_Knight realizes gratitude, this strengthens his feelings towards Princess, so another positive emotional link is added.\n\nKidnapping Princess introduces a prisoner tension and also causes fear in her, affecting their friendship bond negatively. So, I'll include both a negative emotional link and the new tension.\n\nJaguar_Knight praying for help doesn't change much emotionally but keeps the existing tensions in place.\n\nPrincess confronting the enemy angrily shows her determination, slightly increasing Princess's positive feelings towards Jaguar_Knight due to his rescue efforts.\n\nSearching for the enemy keeps the prisoner tension active without changing emotional links.\n\nFinding the enemy leads to an attack, which introduces a life_at_risk tension and negative emotions from both characters involved.\n\nAttacking the enemy furthers the life risk and creates more negative emotions towards each other.\n\nKilling the enemy resolves the prisoner tension but doesn't directly affect emotional links beyond what's already established.\n\nPerforming the ceremony after killing doesn't change tensions but may strengthen Jaguar_Knight's resolve, so a positive self-emotional link is noted.\n\nLiberating Princess resolves the prisoner tension and strengthens their bond with positive emotions.\n\nPrincess falling in love obviously increases her romantic feelings towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\nKissing him follows naturally from her romantic feelings.\n\nRecognizing the tattoo introduces internal conflict for Princess, creating clashing emotions without changing tensions.\n\nFeeling conflicted leads to negative emotional links due to her mixed feelings.\n\nKilling Jaguar_Knight results in his death and Princess's guilt, affecting both their emotional states negatively.\n\nFinally, Princess taking her own life concludes with her death and grief from the loss.\n\nThroughout this process, I need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the changes resulting from the action, avoiding repetition of preconditions.

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`.\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, so I need to verify each action in the story for logical consistency regarding preconditions and postconditions. The user provided a detailed set of instructions on how to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, and the actions make sense within the narrative.

Starting with "storm_caused_damage," this action affects Jaguar_Knight's health. Since n_characters is 1, only 'a' should be referenced. However, in the preconditions and postconditions, '-' was used, which might not align with 'n_characters'. I'll adjust it to use 'a' for clarity.

When Jaguar_Knight gets injured, this involves both him and Princess. The preconditions and postconditions correctly reference 'a' (Jaguar) and 'b' (Princess), so no changes are needed here.

For "character_saved," the action is by Princess ('a') saving Jaguar ('b'). The emotional link from Princess to Jaguar is correctly set, ensuring n_characters matches the references.

In "princess_kidnapped," the subject is Enemy ('a'), and object is Princess ('b'). The preconditions and postconditions accurately reflect this with 'a' and 'b'.

When reviewing all actions, I'll ensure that if a character dies, no further emotional links or tensions are assigned to them. For example, after Jaguar_Knight's death, only Princess should experience emotions.

I'll also check that postconditions don't repeat preconditions unless there's a clear change in state. For instance, resolving a tension with 'prisoner_freed' only occurs once the action is taken.

Ensuring that keys like 'type', 'magnitude', 'from', and 'to' are present in each emotional link and tension object is crucial for JSON validity. I'll scan through each action to confirm this.

Finally, I'll make sure that references to characters use only 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object), avoiding any other values unless it's a general or self-referential action.

Story:  Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"Does she live far off?" said the wolf

"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."

"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"

"All the better to hug you with, my dear."

"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"

"All the better to run with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"Does she live far off?" said the wolf

"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."

"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"

"All the better to hug you with, my dear."

"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"

"All the better to run with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions from the narrative.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Little Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, her mother, and a wolf. The main events involve the girl visiting her sick grandmother with some treats, encountering a wolf who eats the grandmother and then disguises himself as her. Eventually, the wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood too.

Now, focusing on emotional links: there's love between the mother and daughter, grandmother and granddaughter. The mother sends Little Red to see her grandmother because she's ill, showing care. That's an action of love from the mother towards the daughter and grandmother.

The girl interacts with the wolf, but that's more about tension than emotional links. So the first action is the mother sending her daughter, which involves three characters: the subject is the mother, object is Little Red Riding Hood, and it's a love link.

Next, when Little Red meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him where she's going, which might not directly relate to emotional links but sets up the tension. However, since the wolf is a threat, this starts building tension, specifically life_at_risk for both her and her grandmother.

Then, the wolf reaches the grandmother's house first, knocks on the door, disguises his voice, and eats her. This creates a character_dead tension because the grandmother dies here. The action is the wolf eating the grandmother, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother.

After that, Little Red arrives, talks to the wolf (who's disguised), which again relates to life_at_risk because she doesn't know the danger. She enters and they converse, but when she notices something's wrong with "grandmother," the wolf reveals himself and eats her too. This adds another character_dead tension as both grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood die.

So I need to map these events into JSON actions. Each action should be a general statement without names, using snake_case. The keys are action, n_characters, subject, object.

Let me list the steps:

1. Mother sends daughter with cakes: subject is mother, object is daughter.
2. Daughter meets wolf and talks: both are subjects and objects, so n_characters=2.
3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house, eats her: subject is wolf, object is grandmother.
4. Grandmother dies (tension).
5. Daughter interacts with disguised wolf: n_characters=2.
6. Daughter gets suspicious about "grandmother": no specific action here, but the next action is wolf eating her.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down more accurately:

- Mother sends daughter to grandmother: that's one action.
- Daughter meets wolf and tells him where she's going: another action.
- Wolf arrives at grandmother's house, disguises as her: action with subject wolf, object grandmother (but she dies).
- Grandmother's death is a postcondition, so an action where wolf eats grandmother.
- Daughter arrives, talks to wolf (disguised), which leads to her entry and the wolf eating her.

So I think six actions:

1. Mother sends daughter on errand with cakes.
2. Daughter meets wolf in forest and tells him destination.
3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house first and eats her.
4. Grandmother dies (tension).
5. Daughter talks to disguised wolf upon arrival.
6. Wolf reveals identity and eats the daughter.

Wait, but I need to ensure each action relates to emotional links or tensions.

So:

1. Mother sends daughter: love link from mother to daughter and grandmother.
2. Daughter meets wolf: starts life_at_risk tension for both.
3. Wolf eats grandmother: character_dead tension.
4. Grandmother dies (tension).
5. Daughter interacts with wolf, increasing tension until she's eaten.

I think the actions are:

1. send_little_red_with_cakes
2. little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination
3. wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother
4. grandmother_dies (tension)
5. little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf
6. wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red

Each action needs to be in snake_case, general terms without names.

So the JSON will have these actions with their subjects and objects.
</think>

Here is the structured analysis of the story based on emotional links and tensions:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "send_little_red_with_cakes",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "mother",
    "object": "little_red_riding_hood"
  },
  {
    "action": "little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "little_red_riding_hood",
    "object": "wolf"
  },
  {
    "action": "wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "wolf",
    "object": "grandmother"
  },
  {
    "action": "grandmother_dies",
    "n_characters": 1,
    "subject": "-",
    "object": "-"
  },
  {
    "action": "little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "little_red_riding_hood",
    "object": "wolf"
  },
  {
    "action": "wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "wolf",
    "object": "little_red_riding_hood"
  }
]
```

This JSON captures the key actions, focusing on emotional links (love) and tensions (life_at_risk, character_dead), organized chronologically.

Alright, I need to help the user enhance their previous JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The user has provided a specific structure they want me to follow, which includes adding a `preconditions` key to each action, containing an array of `emotional_links`. Each emotional link should have `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.

First, I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - **Subject:** mother
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - The mother is sending her daughter because she's concerned about the grandmother's health. This indicates a strong positive emotional link of type `love` from the mother to both the daughter and the grandmother.
   - So, two emotional links here: one from 'a' (mother) to 'b' (daughter), and another from 'a' (mother) to the grandmother (though since the object is only the daughter in this action, maybe I should focus on what's directly relevant. But the user allows for other characters, so including both makes sense.)

2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf
   - Little Red is naive and trusting. She doesn't have any specific emotional link with the wolf yet; she just meets him and tells him her plans. So no significant emotional links here.

3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** grandmother
   - The wolf is hungry and sees the grandmother as prey. This indicates a negative emotional link of type `friendship` (since it's not romantic) with high magnitude towards the grandmother, driven by hunger.

4. **Action: grandmother_dies**
   - There are no subjects or objects here, just an event. So no preconditions related to emotional links.

5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)
   - Little Red loves her grandmother and expects her to be loving in return. So there's a positive emotional link of type `love` from Little Red ('a') to the wolf ('b'), thinking it's her grandmother.

6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - The wolf has a negative emotional link towards Little Red, driven by hunger and deception. So type `friendship` with a magnitude of -3.

I need to ensure each precondition is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions. For each action, I'll check if there are any required emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.

Now, mapping this out in JSON format:

1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - Emotional Links:
     - From mother ('a') to daughter ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3.
     - From mother ('a') to grandmother: type `love`, magnitude 3 (though the object here is the daughter, but the action is driven by love towards both).

2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - No emotional links required.

3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - Emotional Links:
     - From wolf ('a') to grandmother ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3 (hatred/hunger).

4. **grandmother_dies**
   - No preconditions as no subjects or objects involved.

5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - Emotional Links:
     - From Little Red ('a') to wolf ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3 (thinking it's her grandmother).

6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - Emotional Links:
     - From wolf ('a') to Little Red ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3.

I need to represent this in the JSON structure, adding the `preconditions` key with an array of emotional links for each action where applicable.

Here is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions from the narrative.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Little Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, her mother, and a wolf. The main events involve the girl visiting her sick grandmother with some treats, encountering a wolf who eats the grandmother and then disguises himself as her. Eventually, the wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood too.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: there's love between the mother and daughter, grandmother and granddaughter. The mother sends Little Red to see her grandmother because she's ill, showing care. That's an action of love from the mother towards the daughter and grandmother.\n\nThe girl interacts with the wolf, but that's more about tension than emotional links. So the first action is the mother sending her daughter, which involves three characters: the subject is the mother, object is Little Red Riding Hood, and it's a love link.\n\nNext, when Little Red meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him where she's going, which might not directly relate to emotional links but sets up the tension. However, since the wolf is a threat, this starts building tension, specifically life_at_risk for both her and her grandmother.\n\nThen, the wolf reaches the grandmother's house first, knocks on the door, disguises his voice, and eats her. This creates a character_dead tension because the grandmother dies here. The action is the wolf eating the grandmother, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n\nAfter that, Little Red arrives, talks to the wolf (who's disguised), which again relates to life_at_risk because she doesn't know the danger. She enters and they converse, but when she notices something's wrong with \"grandmother,\" the wolf reveals himself and eats her too. This adds another character_dead tension as both grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood die.\n\nSo I need to map these events into JSON actions. Each action should be a general statement without names, using snake_case. The keys are action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter with cakes: subject is mother, object is daughter.\n2. Daughter meets wolf and talks: both are subjects and objects, so n_characters=2.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house, eats her: subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter interacts with disguised wolf: n_characters=2.\n6. Daughter gets suspicious about \"grandmother\": no specific action here, but the next action is wolf eating her.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down more accurately:\n\n- Mother sends daughter to grandmother: that's one action.\n- Daughter meets wolf and tells him where she's going: another action.\n- Wolf arrives at grandmother's house, disguises as her: action with subject wolf, object grandmother (but she dies).\n- Grandmother's death is a postcondition, so an action where wolf eats grandmother.\n- Daughter arrives, talks to wolf (disguised), which leads to her entry and the wolf eating her.\n\nSo I think six actions:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter on errand with cakes.\n2. Daughter meets wolf in forest and tells him destination.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house first and eats her.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter talks to disguised wolf upon arrival.\n6. Wolf reveals identity and eats the daughter.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each action relates to emotional links or tensions.\n\nSo:\n\n1.

The user has provided a specific structure they want me to follow, which includes adding a `preconditions` key to each action, containing an array of `emotional_links`. Each emotional link should have `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - **Subject:** mother\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The mother is sending her daughter because she's concerned about the grandmother's health. This indicates a strong positive emotional link of type `love` from the mother to both the daughter and the grandmother.\n   - So, two emotional links here: one from 'a' (mother) to 'b' (daughter), and another from 'a' (mother) to the grandmother (though since the object is only the daughter in this action, maybe I should focus on what's directly relevant. But the user allows for other characters, so including both makes sense.)\n\n2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf\n   - Little Red is naive and trusting. She doesn't have any specific emotional link with the wolf yet; she just meets him and tells him her plans. So no significant emotional links here.\n\n3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** grandmother\n   - The wolf is hungry and sees the grandmother as prey. This indicates a negative emotional link of type `friendship` (since it's not romantic) with high magnitude towards the grandmother, driven by hunger.\n\n4. **Action: grandmother_dies**\n   - There are no subjects or objects here, just an event. So no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)\n   - Little Red loves her grandmother and expects her to be loving in return. So there's a positive emotional link of type `love` from Little Red ('a') to the wolf ('b'), thinking it's her grandmother.\n\n6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The wolf has a negative emotional link towards Little Red, driven by hunger and deception. So type `friendship` with a magnitude of -3.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions. For each action, I'll check if there are any required emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nNow, mapping this out in JSON format:\n\n1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From mother ('a') to daughter ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3.\n     - From mother ('a') to grandmother: type `love`, magnitude 3 (though the object here is the daughter, but the action is driven by love towards both).\n\n2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - No emotional links required.\n\n3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From wolf ('a') to grandmother ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3 (hatred/hunger).\n\n4. **grandmother_dies**\n   - No preconditions as no subjects or objects involved.\n\n5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From Little Red ('a') to wolf ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3 (thinking it's her grandmother).\n\n6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From wolf ('a') to Little Red ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3.\n\nI need to represent this in the JSON structure, adding the `preconditions` key with an array of emotional links for each action where applicable.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"send_little_red_with_cakes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"grandmother_dies\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {}\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure includes preconditions for each action where emotional links are relevant, providing a clear understanding of the motivations behind each character's actions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Okay, so I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding preconditions related to tensions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The user has provided a specific structure they want me to follow, which includes adding a `tensions` array within the `preconditions` key for each action. Each tension should have `type`, `from`, and `to`.

First, I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - **Subject:** mother
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - The mother sends her daughter because the grandmother is ill. This implies a tension of `health_at_risk` for the grandmother, motivating the action.
   
2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf
   - The presence of the wolf introduces a threat to Little Red's safety, creating a `life_at_risk` tension for her.

3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** grandmother
   - This action results in the grandmother's death, so there's a `character_dead` tension here.

4. **Action: grandmother_dies**
   - There are no subjects or objects here, just an event. So no preconditions related to tensions since it's the result of the previous action.

5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)
   - Little Red is unaware of the danger, but the wolf's disguise creates a `life_at_risk` tension for her.

6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - This action results in Little Red's death, so there's a `character_dead` tension here, and also `life_at_risk` before the actual death.

Now, I need to represent these tensions in the JSON structure. For each action, if there are no relevant tensions, the array will be empty.

Here’s how I would map this:

1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - Tensions: `health_at_risk` for grandmother.

2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` for Little Red.

3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - Tensions: `character_dead` for grandmother.

4. **grandmother_dies**
   - No tensions as it's a result, not a precondition.

5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` for Little Red.

6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - Tensions: `character_dead` and `life_at_risk` for Little Red.

I need to ensure that each tension is correctly formatted with `type`, `from`, and `to`. Using 'a' for the subject, 'b' for the object, and appropriate values otherwise.

By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions from the narrative.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Little Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, her mother, and a wolf. The main events involve the girl visiting her sick grandmother with some treats, encountering a wolf who eats the grandmother and then disguises himself as her. Eventually, the wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood too.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: there's love between the mother and daughter, grandmother and granddaughter. The mother sends Little Red to see her grandmother because she's ill, showing care. That's an action of love from the mother towards the daughter and grandmother.\n\nThe girl interacts with the wolf, but that's more about tension than emotional links. So the first action is the mother sending her daughter, which involves three characters: the subject is the mother, object is Little Red Riding Hood, and it's a love link.\n\nNext, when Little Red meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him where she's going, which might not directly relate to emotional links but sets up the tension. However, since the wolf is a threat, this starts building tension, specifically life_at_risk for both her and her grandmother.\n\nThen, the wolf reaches the grandmother's house first, knocks on the door, disguises his voice, and eats her. This creates a character_dead tension because the grandmother dies here. The action is the wolf eating the grandmother, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n\nAfter that, Little Red arrives, talks to the wolf (who's disguised), which again relates to life_at_risk because she doesn't know the danger. She enters and they converse, but when she notices something's wrong with \"grandmother,\" the wolf reveals himself and eats her too. This adds another character_dead tension as both grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood die.\n\nSo I need to map these events into JSON actions. Each action should be a general statement without names, using snake_case. The keys are action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter with cakes: subject is mother, object is daughter.\n2. Daughter meets wolf and talks: both are subjects and objects, so n_characters=2.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house, eats her: subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter interacts with disguised wolf: n_characters=2.\n6. Daughter gets suspicious about \"grandmother\": no specific action here, but the next action is wolf eating her.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down more accurately:\n\n- Mother sends daughter to grandmother: that's one action.\n- Daughter meets wolf and tells him where she's going: another action.\n- Wolf arrives at grandmother's house, disguises as her: action with subject wolf, object grandmother (but she dies).\n- Grandmother's death is a postcondition, so an action where wolf eats grandmother.\n- Daughter arrives, talks to wolf (disguised), which leads to her entry and the wolf eating her.\n\nSo I think six actions:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter on errand with cakes.\n2. Daughter meets wolf in forest and tells him destination.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house first and eats her.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter talks to disguised wolf upon arrival.\n6. Wolf reveals identity and eats the daughter.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each action relates to emotional links or tensions.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter: love link from mother to daughter and grandmother.\n2. Daughter meets wolf: starts life_at_risk tension for both.\n3. Wolf eats grandmother: character_dead tension.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter interacts with wolf, increasing tension until she's eaten.\n\nI think the actions are:\n\n1. send_little_red_with_cakes\n2. little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\n3. wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\n4. grandmother_dies (tension)\n5. little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\n6. wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case, general terms without names.\n\nSo the JSON will have these actions with their subjects and objects.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story based on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"send_little_red_with_cakes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"grandmother_dies\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the key actions, focusing on emotional links (love) and tensions (life_at_risk, character_dead), organized chronologically.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user enhance their previous JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The user has provided a specific structure they want me to follow, which includes adding a `preconditions` key to each action, containing an array of `emotional_links`. Each emotional link should have `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - **Subject:** mother\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The mother is sending her daughter because she's concerned about the grandmother's health. This indicates a strong positive emotional link of type `love` from the mother to both the daughter and the grandmother.\n   - So, two emotional links here: one from 'a' (mother) to 'b' (daughter), and another from 'a' (mother) to the grandmother (though since the object is only the daughter in this action, maybe I should focus on what's directly relevant. But the user allows for other characters, so including both makes sense.)\n\n2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf\n   - Little Red is naive and trusting. She doesn't have any specific emotional link with the wolf yet; she just meets him and tells him her plans. So no significant emotional links here.\n\n3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** grandmother\n   - The wolf is hungry and sees the grandmother as prey. This indicates a negative emotional link of type `friendship` (since it's not romantic) with high magnitude towards the grandmother, driven by hunger.\n\n4. **Action: grandmother_dies**\n   - There are no subjects or objects here, just an event. So no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)\n   - Little Red loves her grandmother and expects her to be loving in return. So there's a positive emotional link of type `love` from Little Red ('a') to the wolf ('b'), thinking it's her grandmother.\n\n6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The wolf has a negative emotional link towards Little Red, driven by hunger and deception. So type `friendship` with a magnitude of -3.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions. For each action, I'll check if there are any required emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nNow, mapping this out in JSON format:\n\n1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From mother ('a') to daughter ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3.\n     - From mother ('a') to grandmother: type `love`, magnitude 3 (though the object here is the daughter, but the action is driven by love towards both).\n\n2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - No emotional links required.\n\n3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From wolf ('a') to grandmother ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3 (hatred/hunger).\n\n4. **grandmother_dies**\n   - No preconditions as no subjects or objects involved.\n\n5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From Little Red ('a') to wolf ('b'): type `love`, magnitude 3 (thinking it's her grandmother).\n\n6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - From wolf ('a') to Little Red ('b'): type `friendship`, magnitude -3.\n\nI need to represent this in the JSON structure, adding the `preconditions` key with an array of emotional links for each action where applicable.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"send_little_red_with_cakes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"grandmother_dies\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {}\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure includes preconditions for each action where emotional links are relevant, providing a clear understanding of the motivations behind each character's actions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Okay, so I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding postconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The user has provided specific instructions on what postconditions are and how they should be structured. Postconditions include changes to emotional links and tensions resulting from the action.

First, I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - **Subject:** mother
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - The mother sends her daughter with cakes for the grandmother because she's ill. This action strengthens the positive emotional link of `love` between the mother and Little Red, as well as between the mother and the grandmother.
   - Tensions: The grandmother's health is at risk, so the tension `health_at_risk` is introduced.

2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf
   - Little Red meets the wolf and tells him where she's going. The wolf now knows her destination, increasing the tension `life_at_risk` for both Little Red and her grandmother.
   - Emotional Links: No significant change here since they just met.

3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** grandmother
   - The wolf eats the grandmother, which results in her death. This introduces the tension `character_dead` for the grandmother.
   - Emotional Links: The wolf develops a negative emotional link of `friendship` towards the grandmother due to his predatory nature.

4. **Action: grandmother_dies**
   - There are no subjects or objects here; it's just an event. So, this action results in the tension `character_dead` for the grandmother.
   - Emotional Links: None, as it's a result of the previous action.

5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood
   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)
   - Little Red interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This creates a positive emotional link of `love` from Little Red towards the disguised wolf.
   - Tensions: The interaction increases the tension `life_at_risk` for Little Red.

6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - **Subject:** wolf
   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood
   - The wolf reveals his true identity and eats Little Red, resulting in her death. This introduces the tension `character_dead` for Little Red.
   - Emotional Links: The wolf develops a negative emotional link of `friendship` towards Little Red.

Now, I need to represent these postconditions in the JSON structure. For each action, I'll add `postconditions` with `emotional_links` and `tensions`.

Here’s how I would map this:

1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - Emotional Links:
     - Mother to Little Red: `love`, +2
     - Mother to Grandmother: `love`, +2
   - Tensions:
     - `health_at_risk` for grandmother

2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - Emotional Links: None
   - Tensions:
     - `life_at_risk` for Little Red and Grandmother

3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - Emotional Links:
     - Wolf to Grandmother: `friendship`, -2
   - Tensions:
     - `character_dead` for Grandmother

4. **grandmother_dies**
   - Emotional Links: None
   - Tensions:
     - `character_dead` for Grandmother

5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - Emotional Links:
     - Little Red to Wolf (disguised): `love`, +2
   - Tensions:
     - `life_at_risk` for Little Red

6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - Emotional Links:
     - Wolf to Little Red: `friendship`, -2
   - Tensions:
     - `character_dead` for Little Red

I need to ensure that each postcondition is correctly formatted with the appropriate keys and values, indicating how emotional links and tensions are affected by each action.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions from the narrative.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Little Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, her mother, and a wolf. The main events involve the girl visiting her sick grandmother with some treats, encountering a wolf who eats the grandmother and then disguises himself as her. Eventually, the wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood too.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: there's love between the mother and daughter, grandmother and granddaughter. The mother sends Little Red to see her grandmother because she's ill, showing care. That's an action of love from the mother towards the daughter and grandmother.\n\nThe girl interacts with the wolf, but that's more about tension than emotional links. So the first action is the mother sending her daughter, which involves three characters: the subject is the mother, object is Little Red Riding Hood, and it's a love link.\n\nNext, when Little Red meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him where she's going, which might not directly relate to emotional links but sets up the tension. However, since the wolf is a threat, this starts building tension, specifically life_at_risk for both her and her grandmother.\n\nThen, the wolf reaches the grandmother's house first, knocks on the door, disguises his voice, and eats her. This creates a character_dead tension because the grandmother dies here. The action is the wolf eating the grandmother, so subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n\nAfter that, Little Red arrives, talks to the wolf (who's disguised), which again relates to life_at_risk because she doesn't know the danger. She enters and they converse, but when she notices something's wrong with \"grandmother,\" the wolf reveals himself and eats her too. This adds another character_dead tension as both grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood die.\n\nSo I need to map these events into JSON actions. Each action should be a general statement without names, using snake_case. The keys are action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter with cakes: subject is mother, object is daughter.\n2. Daughter meets wolf and talks: both are subjects and objects, so n_characters=2.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house, eats her: subject is wolf, object is grandmother.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter interacts with disguised wolf: n_characters=2.\n6. Daughter gets suspicious about \"grandmother\": no specific action here, but the next action is wolf eating her.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down more accurately:\n\n- Mother sends daughter to grandmother: that's one action.\n- Daughter meets wolf and tells him where she's going: another action.\n- Wolf arrives at grandmother's house, disguises as her: action with subject wolf, object grandmother (but she dies).\n- Grandmother's death is a postcondition, so an action where wolf eats grandmother.\n- Daughter arrives, talks to wolf (disguised), which leads to her entry and the wolf eating her.\n\nSo I think six actions:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter on errand with cakes.\n2. Daughter meets wolf in forest and tells him destination.\n3. Wolf reaches grandmother's house first and eats her.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter talks to disguised wolf upon arrival.\n6. Wolf reveals identity and eats the daughter.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each action relates to emotional links or tensions.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Mother sends daughter: love link from mother to daughter and grandmother.\n2. Daughter meets wolf: starts life_at_risk tension for both.\n3. Wolf eats grandmother: character_dead tension.\n4. Grandmother dies (tension).\n5. Daughter interacts with wolf, increasing tension until she's eaten.\n\nI think the actions are:\n\n1. send_little_red_with_cakes\n2. little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\n3. wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\n4. grandmother_dies (tension)\n5. little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\n6. wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\n\nEach action needs to be in snake_case, general terms without names.\n\nSo the JSON will have these actions with their subjects and objects.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story based on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"send_little_red_with_cakes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"grandmother_dies\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the key actions, focusing on emotional links (love) and tensions (life_at_risk, character_dead), organized chronologically.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user has provided a specific structure they want me to follow, which includes adding a `preconditions` key to each action, containing an array of `emotional_links`. Each emotional link should have `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - **Subject:** mother\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The mother is sending her daughter because she's concerned about the grandmother's health. This indicates a strong positive emotional link of type `love` from the mother to both the daughter and the grandmother.\n   - So, two emotional links here: one from 'a' (mother) to 'b' (daughter), and another from 'a' (mother) to the grandmother (though since the object is only the daughter in this action, maybe I should focus on what's directly relevant. But the user allows for other characters, so including both makes sense.)\n\n2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf\n   - Little Red is naive and trusting. She doesn't have any specific emotional link with the wolf yet; she just meets him and tells him her plans. So no significant emotional links here.\n\n3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** grandmother\n   - The wolf is hungry and sees the grandmother as prey. This indicates a negative emotional link of type `friendship` (since it's not romantic) with high magnitude towards the grandmother, driven by hunger.\n\n4. **Action: grandmother_dies**\n   - There are no subjects or objects here, just an event. So no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)\n   - Little Red loves her grandmother and expects her to be loving in return. So there's a positive emotional link of type `love` from Little Red ('a') to the wolf ('b'), thinking it's her grandmother.\n\n6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The wolf has a negative emotional link towards Little Red, driven by hunger and deception. So type `friendship` with a magnitude of -3.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions.

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding postconditions for each action in the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The user has provided specific instructions on what postconditions are and how they should be structured. Postconditions include changes to emotional links and tensions resulting from the action.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - **Subject:** mother\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The mother sends her daughter with cakes for the grandmother because she's ill. This action strengthens the positive emotional link of `love` between the mother and Little Red, as well as between the mother and the grandmother.\n   - Tensions: The grandmother's health is at risk, so the tension `health_at_risk` is introduced.\n\n2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf\n   - Little Red meets the wolf and tells him where she's going. The wolf now knows her destination, increasing the tension `life_at_risk` for both Little Red and her grandmother.\n   - Emotional Links: No significant change here since they just met.\n\n3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** grandmother\n   - The wolf eats the grandmother, which results in her death. This introduces the tension `character_dead` for the grandmother.\n   - Emotional Links: The wolf develops a negative emotional link of `friendship` towards the grandmother due to his predatory nature.\n\n4. **Action: grandmother_dies**\n   - There are no subjects or objects here; it's just an event. So, this action results in the tension `character_dead` for the grandmother.\n   - Emotional Links: None, as it's a result of the previous action.\n\n5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - **Subject:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - **Object:** wolf (disguised as grandmother)\n   - Little Red interacts with the wolf, thinking he's her grandmother. This creates a positive emotional link of `love` from Little Red towards the disguised wolf.\n   - Tensions: The interaction increases the tension `life_at_risk` for Little Red.\n\n6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - **Subject:** wolf\n   - **Object:** little_red_riding_hood\n   - The wolf reveals his true identity and eats Little Red, resulting in her death. This introduces the tension `character_dead` for Little Red.\n   - Emotional Links: The wolf develops a negative emotional link of `friendship` towards Little Red.\n\nNow, I need to represent these postconditions in the JSON structure. For each action, I'll add `postconditions` with `emotional_links` and `tensions`.\n\nHere’s how I would map this:\n\n1. **send_little_red_with_cakes**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - Mother to Little Red: `love`, +2\n     - Mother to Grandmother: `love`, +2\n   - Tensions:\n     - `health_at_risk` for grandmother\n\n2. **little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**\n   - Emotional Links: None\n   - Tensions:\n     - `life_at_risk` for Little Red and Grandmother\n\n3. **wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - Wolf to Grandmother: `friendship`, -2\n   - Tensions:\n     - `character_dead` for Grandmother\n\n4. **grandmother_dies**\n   - Emotional Links: None\n   - Tensions:\n     - `character_dead` for Grandmother\n\n5. **little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - Little Red to Wolf (disguised): `love`, +2\n   - Tensions:\n     - `life_at_risk` for Little Red\n\n6. **wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**\n   - Emotional Links:\n     - Wolf to Little Red: `friendship`, -2\n   - Tensions:\n     - `character_dead` for Little Red\n\nI need to ensure that each postcondition is correctly formatted with the appropriate keys and values, indicating how emotional links and tensions are affected by each action.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with postconditions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"send_little_red_with_cakes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mother\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"grandmother\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"grandmother_dies\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"grandmother\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"little_red_riding_hood\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"little_red_riding_hood\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure includes postconditions that detail the changes in emotional links and tensions resulting from each action, providing a comprehensive understanding of how each event impacts the characters and narrative dynamics.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Ensure logical consistency for each action.

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user verify and correct their JSON object based on the provided instructions. The user has specified several checks to ensure logical consistency in the JSON structure.

First, I'll review each action to ensure that `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only 'a' should be used. Also, if a character dies, they shouldn't have further emotional links or tensions.

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **Action: send_little_red_with_cakes**
   - **n_characters:** 2
   - **Preconditions:** Emotional links from mother to daughter and grandmother.
   - **Postconditions:** Emotional links from mother to daughter and grandmother, tension `health_at_risk` for grandmother.
   - Check: Logical consistency maintained. No dead characters involved.

2. **Action: little_red_meets_wolf_and_tells_destination**
   - **n_characters:** 2
   - **Preconditions:** None.
   - **Postconditions:** Tensions `life_at_risk` for Little Red and grandmother.
   - Check: Both characters are alive, so no issues with emotional links.

3. **Action: wolf_arrives_first_and_eats_grandmother**
   - **n_characters:** 2
   - **Preconditions:** Emotional link from wolf to grandmother (negative).
   - **Postconditions:** Emotional link from wolf to grandmother (negative), tension `character_dead` for grandmother.
   - Check: After this action, grandmother is dead. Any subsequent references should not include her in emotional links or tensions.

4. **Action: grandmother_dies**
   - **n_characters:** 1
   - **Preconditions:** None.
   - **Postconditions:** Tension `character_dead` for grandmother.
   - Check: Since `n_characters` is 1, only 'a' should be used, but in this case, it's '-', indicating no subject or object. Logical since it's an event.

5. **Action: little_red_interacts_with_disguised_wolf**
   - **n_characters:** 2
   - **Preconditions:** Emotional link from Little Red to wolf (positive, thinking it's grandmother).
   - **Postconditions:** Emotional link from Little Red to wolf (positive), tension `life_at_risk` for Little Red.
   - Check: Both characters are alive, so no issues.

6. **Action: wolf_reveals_identity_and_eats_little_red**
   - **n_characters:** 2
   - **Preconditions:** Emotional link from wolf to Little Red (negative).
   - **Postconditions:** Emotional link from wolf to Little Red (negative), tension `character_dead` for Little Red.
   - Check: After this action, Little Red is dead. Any subsequent references should not include her in emotional links or tensions.

Now, I'll ensure that the JSON syntax is correct. Each emotional link has `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension has `type`, `from`, and `to`. No other values are used for `from` and `to` except 'a', 'b', or '-'.

I'll also check that preconditions and postconditions are not the same, as postconditions represent a change in state. For example, if an action creates a new emotional link, it shouldn't be the same as any existing one unless it's intensifying.

Finally, I'll ensure that all expected keys are present and properly formatted.
