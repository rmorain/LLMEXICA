Story:  Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.

The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.

The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.

So he knocked on the door and said:

  Little pig! Little pig!
  Let me in! Let me in!
But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:

  No! No! No! 
  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!
Three Little Pigs, the straw houseThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:

  Then I'll huff 
  and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow your house down.
So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.

The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.

So he knocked on the door and said:

  Little pigs! Little pigs!
  Let me in! Let me in!
But the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:

  No! No! No!
  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!
So the wolf showed his teeth and said:

  Then I'll huff 
  and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow your house down!
So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.

The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.

Three Little Pigs at the Brick House

So the wolf knocked on the door and said:

  Little pigs! Little pigs!
  Let me in! Let me in!
But the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:

  No! No! No! 
  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!
So the wolf showed his teeth and said:

  Then I'll huff 
  and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow your house down.
Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.

But this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.

So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.<｜Assistant｜>"

<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.

Looking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.

Tensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.

Now, I'll go through the story step by step.

1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.

2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.

3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.

4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.

5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.

Wait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.

Wait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.

Wait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.

But since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.

This might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.

So after the first house is blown down:

- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)
- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.

Then, wolf goes to second house:

- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)
- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?

Wait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.

So:

After first attack:
- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)
- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)

After second attack:
- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)
- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)

Then at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:

- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)
- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.

Finally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.

So let me list these actions in order:

1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.
2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.
3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.
4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.
5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.
6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
7. Wolf dies.

Wait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.

So the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.

Now, translating each into JSON:

Action 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house

Wait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had "blows down straw house" but maybe more general like "blow_down_house".

But the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps "blow_down_house".

Similarly, "seek_help", "trap_enemy", etc.

So Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.

Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.

Action 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.

Wait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?

But that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.

I think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.

So I'll proceed similarly:

Action 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.
Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.
Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.
Action 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.

Wait, the action is "seek_help". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.

So:

Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)
Then both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:

Action 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig
Action 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig

But that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.

Hmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.

So:

Action 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.
Action 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.
Action 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.
Action 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.
Action 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.

Then:

Action 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.

Wait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.

So Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.

Then:

Action 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.

Finally:

Action 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.

Wait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action "trap_enemy" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.

So putting it all together:

1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig
2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig
3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig
4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig
5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig
6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig
7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf

Wait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.

So actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.

Alternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.

So the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.

time=2025-04-14T13:54:35.490-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\n\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.\n\nThe next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pig! Little pig!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\nThree Little Pigs, the straw houseThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.\n\nLooking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.\n\nTensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.\n\nNow, I'll go through the story step by step.\n\n1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.\n\n2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.\n\n3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.\n\n4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.\n\n5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.\n\nWait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.\n\nBut since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.\n\nThis might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.\n\nSo after the first house is blown down:\n\n- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)\n- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.\n\nThen, wolf goes to second house:\n\n- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)\n- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?\n\nWait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter first attack:\n- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)\n- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)\n\nAfter second attack:\n- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)\n- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)\n\nThen at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:\n\n- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)\n- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.\n\nFinally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.\n\nSo let me list these actions in order:\n\n1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.\n2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.\n3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.\n4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.\n5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.\n6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n7. Wolf dies.\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.\n\nSo the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.\n\nNow, translating each into JSON:\n\nAction 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house\n\nWait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had \"blows down straw house\" but maybe more general like \"blow_down_house\".\n\nBut the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps \"blow_down_house\".\n\nSimilarly, \"seek_help\", \"trap_enemy\", etc.\n\nSo Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nWait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.\n\nI think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.\n\nSo I'll proceed similarly:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.\nAction 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.\n\nWait, the action is \"seek_help\". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)\nThen both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:\n\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig\n\nBut that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.\n\nHmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.\n\nWait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.\n\nSo Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.\n\nFinally:\n\nAction 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.\n\nWait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action \"trap_enemy\" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig\n2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig\n3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig\n4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig\n5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig\n6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig\n7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.\n\nSo actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.\n\nSo the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

<think>
Alright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and the action itself. My task is to go through each action and identify any emotional links that are preconditions for those actions.

First, let me recall what an emotional link precondition means here: it's an existing relationship between characters (either friendship or love) that must be present for a specific action to make sense. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or love.

Looking at the actions:

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.
   - What emotional link would cause the wolf to attack? Probably hunger or predatory instincts, not an emotional link as defined (friendship or love). So no precondition here.

2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.
   - This action implies that the first pig trusts or likes the second pig enough to ask for help. So a friendship link with a positive magnitude makes sense. Let's say magnitude 2, indicating trust and reliance.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.
   - Similar to the first attack, this is driven by hunger, not an emotional link between wolf and pig. No precondition needed.

4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Again, seeking help implies trust or friendship. So another positive magnitude for friendship, maybe 2.

5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Same reasoning; the second pig trusts the third, so a positive friendship link with magnitude 2.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.
   - Driven by hunger or desire to eat them, not an emotional link. No precondition.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
   - The third pig's action is defensive, likely motivated by fear or self-preservation. However, if we consider the pigs' friendship, they might be protecting each other, so a positive friendship link (maybe magnitude 3 for strong bond) among the pigs could be a precondition enabling them to work together.

Now, I'll go through each action and add the preconditions as inferred.

For actions 2, 4, and 5, there are clear friendships that enable seeking help. For action 7, it's more about their collective safety, so a strong friendship bond makes sense.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\n\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.\n\nThe next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pig! Little pig!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\nThree Little Pigs, the straw houseThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.\n\nLooking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.\n\nTensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.\n\nNow, I'll go through the story step by step.\n\n1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.\n\n2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.\n\n3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.\n\n4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.\n\n5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.\n\nWait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.\n\nBut since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.\n\nThis might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.\n\nSo after the first house is blown down:\n\n- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)\n- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.\n\nThen, wolf goes to second house:\n\n- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)\n- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?\n\nWait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter first attack:\n- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)\n- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)\n\nAfter second attack:\n- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)\n- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)\n\nThen at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:\n\n- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)\n- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.\n\nFinally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.\n\nSo let me list these actions in order:\n\n1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.\n2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.\n3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.\n4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.\n5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.\n6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n7. Wolf dies.\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.\n\nSo the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.\n\nNow, translating each into JSON:\n\nAction 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house\n\nWait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had \"blows down straw house\" but maybe more general like \"blow_down_house\".\n\nBut the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps \"blow_down_house\".\n\nSimilarly, \"seek_help\", \"trap_enemy\", etc.\n\nSo Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nWait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.\n\nI think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.\n\nSo I'll proceed similarly:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.\nAction 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.\n\nWait, the action is \"seek_help\". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)\nThen both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:\n\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig\n\nBut that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.\n\nHmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.\n\nWait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.\n\nSo Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.\n\nFinally:\n\nAction 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.\n\nWait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action \"trap_enemy\" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig\n2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig\n3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig\n4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig\n5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig\n6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig\n7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.\n\nSo actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.\n\nSo the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and the action itself. My task is to go through each action and identify any emotional links that are preconditions for those actions.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an emotional link precondition means here: it's an existing relationship between characters (either friendship or love) that must be present for a specific action to make sense. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or love.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n\n1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.\n   - What emotional link would cause the wolf to attack? Probably hunger or predatory instincts, not an emotional link as defined (friendship or love). So no precondition here.\n\n2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.\n   - This action implies that the first pig trusts or likes the second pig enough to ask for help. So a friendship link with a positive magnitude makes sense. Let's say magnitude 2, indicating trust and reliance.\n\n3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.\n   - Similar to the first attack, this is driven by hunger, not an emotional link between wolf and pig. No precondition needed.\n\n4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Again, seeking help implies trust or friendship. So another positive magnitude for friendship, maybe 2.\n\n5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Same reasoning; the second pig trusts the third, so a positive friendship link with magnitude 2.\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.\n   - Driven by hunger or desire to eat them, not an emotional link. No precondition.\n\n7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n   - The third pig's action is defensive, likely motivated by fear or self-preservation. However, if we consider the pigs' friendship, they might be protecting each other, so a positive friendship link (maybe magnitude 3 for strong bond) among the pigs could be a precondition enabling them to work together.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action and add the preconditions as inferred.\n\nFor actions 2, 4, and 5, there are clear friendships that enable seeking help. For action 7, it's more about their collective safety, so a strong friendship bond makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Alright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and preconditions for emotional links. My task is to add another key under `preconditions` called `tensions`, which will include any relevant tension types that must exist before the action can occur.

First, let me recall what tensions are defined as: they include `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner`. These are states that create tension in the narrative.

Now, I'll go through each action to determine if any tensions must be present for the action to make sense.

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.
   - The wolf is trying to eat the pig, so this creates a `life_at_risk` tension for the first pig. So, a precondition of `life_at_risk` from 'a' (wolf) to 'b' (first_pig).

2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.
   - The first pig is fleeing because his life is at risk after the wolf blew down his house. So, there's an existing tension of `life_at_risk` affecting him.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.
   - Similar to the first action, this puts the second pig's life at risk.

4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Again, the first pig is in a situation where his life is still at risk, prompting him to seek help.

5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - The second pig's life is now at risk after their house was destroyed.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.
   - At this point, all three pigs are in the brick house, and the wolf is trying to get to them, putting their lives at risk.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
   - This action is a response to the ongoing tension where the wolf poses a threat to the pigs' lives.

So, for each action, I need to identify if there's an existing tension that serves as a precondition for the action to occur.

Let me map this out:

1. **blow_down_house** (wolf → first_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to first_pig

2. **seek_help** (first_pig → second_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig

3. **blow_down_house** (wolf → second_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to second_pig

4. **seek_help** (first_pig → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig

5. **seek_help** (second_pig → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting second_pig

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney** (wolf → third_pig)
   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to all pigs

7. **trap_enemy** (third_pig → wolf)
   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting all pigs, prompting defensive action

Now, I'll incorporate these tensions into the JSON structure under `preconditions` for each action.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\n\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.\n\nThe next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pig! Little pig!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\nThree Little Pigs, the straw houseThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.\n\nLooking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.\n\nTensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.\n\nNow, I'll go through the story step by step.\n\n1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.\n\n2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.\n\n3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.\n\n4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.\n\n5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.\n\nWait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.\n\nBut since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.\n\nThis might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.\n\nSo after the first house is blown down:\n\n- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)\n- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.\n\nThen, wolf goes to second house:\n\n- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)\n- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?\n\nWait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter first attack:\n- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)\n- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)\n\nAfter second attack:\n- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)\n- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)\n\nThen at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:\n\n- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)\n- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.\n\nFinally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.\n\nSo let me list these actions in order:\n\n1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.\n2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.\n3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.\n4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.\n5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.\n6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n7. Wolf dies.\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.\n\nSo the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.\n\nNow, translating each into JSON:\n\nAction 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house\n\nWait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had \"blows down straw house\" but maybe more general like \"blow_down_house\".\n\nBut the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps \"blow_down_house\".\n\nSimilarly, \"seek_help\", \"trap_enemy\", etc.\n\nSo Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nWait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.\n\nI think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.\n\nSo I'll proceed similarly:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.\nAction 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.\n\nWait, the action is \"seek_help\". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)\nThen both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:\n\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig\n\nBut that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.\n\nHmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.\n\nWait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.\n\nSo Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.\n\nFinally:\n\nAction 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.\n\nWait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action \"trap_enemy\" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig\n2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig\n3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig\n4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig\n5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig\n6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig\n7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.\n\nSo actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.\n\nSo the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4.

The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and the action itself. My task is to go through each action and identify any emotional links that are preconditions for those actions.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an emotional link precondition means here: it's an existing relationship between characters (either friendship or love) that must be present for a specific action to make sense. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or love.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n\n1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.\n   - What emotional link would cause the wolf to attack? Probably hunger or predatory instincts, not an emotional link as defined (friendship or love). So no precondition here.\n\n2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.\n   - This action implies that the first pig trusts or likes the second pig enough to ask for help. So a friendship link with a positive magnitude makes sense. Let's say magnitude 2, indicating trust and reliance.\n\n3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.\n   - Similar to the first attack, this is driven by hunger, not an emotional link between wolf and pig. No precondition needed.\n\n4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Again, seeking help implies trust or friendship. So another positive magnitude for friendship, maybe 2.\n\n5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Same reasoning; the second pig trusts the third, so a positive friendship link with magnitude 2.\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.\n   - Driven by hunger or desire to eat them, not an emotional link. No precondition.\n\n7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n   - The third pig's action is defensive, likely motivated by fear or self-preservation. However, if we consider the pigs' friendship, they might be protecting each other, so a positive friendship link (maybe magnitude 3 for strong bond) among the pigs could be a precondition enabling them to work together.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action and add the preconditions as inferred.\n\nFor actions 2, 4, and 5, there are clear friendships that enable seeking help. For action 7, it's more about their collective safety, so a strong friendship bond makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Okay, I need to identify postconditions for each action in the story analysis. Postconditions are changes resulting from the actions, affecting either emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they can't be the same as preconditions if those exist.

Let me go through each action:

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.
   - This creates fear in the pig towards the wolf (negative emotional link).
   - The tension of `life_at_risk` is now active for the pig.

2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.
   - This strengthens their friendship bond.
   - The first pig's life remains at risk until they find safety.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.
   - Both pigs now have a stronger fear of the wolf (negative emotional links).
   - Their lives are now more directly at risk.

4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Strengthens friendship between first and third pigs.
   - Life_at_risk tension continues until they reach safety.

5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.
   - Strengthens friendship between second and third pigs.
   - Both pigs' lives remain at risk.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.
   - Increases the pigs' fear, strengthening negative emotional links towards the wolf.
   - Life_at_risk tension escalates as the wolf gets closer.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.
   - The pigs feel safer and more trusting among themselves (positive emotional links).
   - Resolves the life_at_risk tension for all pigs, replacing it with life_normal.

Now, I'll map these postconditions into the JSON structure under `postconditions` with `emotional_links` and `tensions`.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\n\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.\n\nThe next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pig! Little pig!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\nThree Little Pigs, the straw houseThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of the Three Little Pigs and extract the essential actions related to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions (like someone dying, life at risk, etc.). The user wants these in a specific JSON format with each action having subject, object, n_characters, and the action itself.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about three pigs building houses and a wolf trying to eat them. The mother pig sends her sons out because she can't feed them. Each pig builds a house of straw, sticks, or bricks.\n\nLooking for emotional links: The pigs are siblings, so their interactions might show friendship. For example, when the first pig runs to the second's house after his is blown down. That shows they help each other, indicating friendship.\n\nTensions include the wolf threatening their lives. Each time the wolf blows a house down, that's a life-at-risk situation. The final part where the wolf falls into boiling water and gets eaten could be considered as a character dead.\n\nNow, I'll go through the story step by step.\n\n1. Mother pig sends her three sons out because she can't feed them. This is an action but doesn't involve emotional links or tension directly. So maybe not include this unless it's about the mother's care, which could be love. But since the focus is on pigs' actions among themselves and with the wolf.\n\n2. First pig builds a straw house, second with sticks, third with bricks. These are individual actions without direct interaction, so probably not relevant for emotional links but may set up future tensions.\n\n3. Wolf approaches first pig's house, tries to get in, blows it down. This is a tension (life_at_risk). The action here would be the wolf threatening and blowing the house, leading the pig to escape. So that's an action where subject is wolf, object is first pig, n_characters=2.\n\n4. First pig escapes and hides with second pig. This shows friendship as they support each other. So action: seek_help, subject=first_pig, object=second_pig.\n\n5. Wolf then goes to the second house, same scenario: tries to get in, blows it down. Another life_at_risk tension. Action: wolf blows house, subject=wolf, object=second_pig. But since both pigs are there, maybe object is plural? Wait, in JSON, each action should have a single subject and object. So perhaps two separate actions for each pig? Or maybe one with n_characters=2? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user example had each action with individual objects, like first_pig, second_pig, third_pig. So maybe when both pigs are involved, we can list them as separate entries or have a single entry with object as 'second_pig' and 'third_pig' but JSON might need arrays which isn't specified here.\n\nWait, no, the example given has each action with individual subjects and objects. So perhaps for the second house, the wolf's action is directed at both pigs, so two actions: one for each pig? Or maybe combine into a single action where subject is wolf, object is second_pig and third_pig, but n_characters=3? Not sure. Maybe better to separate them.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, after the first house, the first pig runs to the second, so that's an action with subject=first_pig, object=second_pig. Then when the wolf blows the second house, it's directed at both pigs there, but perhaps each pig is an object.\n\nBut since in JSON each action can only have one subject and one object, maybe we need two actions for each pig when the wolf attacks the second house. Alternatively, if the action affects multiple characters, perhaps list them as separate entries.\n\nThis might complicate things. Maybe it's better to treat each interaction separately, even if similar.\n\nSo after the first house is blown down:\n\n- Action 1: wolf threatens and blows down straw house (object=first_pig)\n- Then, first pig seeks help from second pig.\n\nThen, wolf goes to second house:\n\n- Action 2: wolf threatens and blows down stick house (object=second_pig)\n- Both pigs escape to third's house. So action: both pigs seek help from third pig? Or each individually?\n\nWait, in the story, after the first house is blown down, first pig runs to second. Then when the wolf comes to the second house, both run to the third.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter first attack:\n- Wolf blows straw house (action 1)\n- First pig seeks help from second (action 2)\n\nAfter second attack:\n- Wolf blows stick house (action 3)\n- Both pigs seek help from third (action 4)\n\nThen at the brick house, wolf can't blow it down but tries to come down chimney. So:\n\n- Wolf threatens to enter through chimney (tension: life_at_risk)\n- Third pig prepares trap, causing wolf to fall into boiling water.\n\nFinally, wolf dies (character_dead), so that's another action.\n\nSo let me list these actions in order:\n\n1. Wolf blows straw house, putting first pig's life at risk.\n2. First pig seeks help from second pig, showing friendship.\n3. Wolf blows stick house, putting second pig's life at risk.\n4. Both pigs (first and second) seek help from third pig.\n5. Wolf attempts to enter brick house through chimney, threatening the pigs' lives.\n6. Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n7. Wolf dies.\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes down the chimney, he falls into boiling water and is boiled. So that's the action where third pig causes the wolf's death.\n\nSo the JSON should include these actions with appropriate subjects, objects, n_characters.\n\nNow, translating each into JSON:\n\nAction 1: subject=wolf, object=first_pig, n_characters=2, action=blow_down_house\n\nWait, but blow_down_house is specific. The user example had \"blows down straw house\" but maybe more general like \"blow_down_house\".\n\nBut the user said to make actions as simple and general as possible, so perhaps \"blow_down_house\".\n\nSimilarly, \"seek_help\", \"trap_enemy\", etc.\n\nSo Action 1: wolf blows down first pig's house. So subject=wolf, object=first_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig. Subject=first_pig, object=second_pig, action=seek_help, n_characters=2.\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second pig's house. subject=wolf, object=second_pig, action=blow_down_house, n_characters=2.\n\nWait, but when the wolf blows the stick house, both pigs are there. So perhaps the object should be both first and second pigs? But in JSON, each action can only have one object. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two separate actions: one for each pig as object. So action 3a: wolf blows down stick house (object=second_pig), and action 3b: same but with first_pig?\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, treat the action as affecting both pigs, so n_characters=3? Or just consider it as one action targeting the second pig's house where both are present.\n\nI think in the example given by the user, they treated each attack on a house as an individual action with the respective pig as object.\n\nSo I'll proceed similarly:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's straw house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's stick house.\nAction 4: second_pig and first_pig seek help from third_pig. But since each action can only have one subject and object, maybe two actions here? Or perhaps combine them.\n\nWait, the action is \"seek_help\". So after their houses are blown, they go to the third pig.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house (subject=wolf, object=second_pig)\nThen both pigs run to third. But in JSON, each action must have one subject and object. So perhaps two actions:\n\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig\n\nBut that might be too granular. Alternatively, create a single action where both pigs are subjects seeking help from the same object (third pig). But JSON structure may not allow multiple subjects.\n\nHmm. Maybe better to have two separate actions for each pig seeking help.\n\nSo:\n\nAction 1: wolf blows down first_pig's house.\nAction 2: first_pig seeks help from second_pig.\nAction 3: wolf blows down second_pig's house.\nAction 4: first_pig seeks help from third_pig.\nAction 5: second_pig seeks help from third_pig.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 6: wolf tries to blow down brick house but fails. So subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=blow_down_house (failed), n_characters=2.\n\nWait, in the story, after failing to blow down the brick house, wolf tries to come down chimney.\n\nSo Action 7: wolf attempts to enter through chimney. Subject=wolf, object=third_pig, action=attempt_enter_through_chimney, n_characters=2.\n\nThen:\n\nAction 8: third_pig traps wolf in boiling water. Subject=third_pig, object=wolf, action=trap_enemy, n_characters=2.\n\nFinally:\n\nAction 9: wolf dies (character_dead). But the JSON structure as per user's example doesn't include this directly unless it's part of an action. So maybe the trapping leads to his death, so that can be noted in the postcondition.\n\nWait, but each action should have subject and object. The death is a result of the trap, so perhaps the action \"trap_enemy\" would suffice, with the effect being the wolf dies.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. blow_down_house (straw) by wolf to first_pig\n2. seek_help from second_pig by first_pig\n3. blow_down_house (sticks) by wolf to second_pig\n4. seek_help from third_pig by first_pig\n5. seek_help from third_pig by second_pig\n6. attempt_enter_through_chimney by wolf to third_pig\n7. trap_enemy by third_pig to wolf\n\nWait, but in the story, when the wolf comes to the brick house, all three pigs are inside. So perhaps after the first two pigs seek help from the third, they are all there.\n\nSo actions 4 and 5 would be both pigs seeking help from third pig, which can be separate or combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a single action where both pigs seek help together, but since each action needs individual subjects, perhaps have two actions: first_pig seeks help, second_pig seeks help.\n\nSo the JSON array will include these seven actions in order.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user has provided a JSON array of actions with subjects, objects, n_characters, and the action itself. My task is to go through each action and identify any emotional links that are preconditions for those actions.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an emotional link precondition means here: it's an existing relationship between characters (either friendship or love) that must be present for a specific action to make sense. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or love.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n\n1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.\n   - What emotional link would cause the wolf to attack? Probably hunger or predatory instincts, not an emotional link as defined (friendship or love). So no precondition here.\n\n2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.\n   - This action implies that the first pig trusts or likes the second pig enough to ask for help. So a friendship link with a positive magnitude makes sense. Let's say magnitude 2, indicating trust and reliance.\n\n3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.\n   - Similar to the first attack, this is driven by hunger, not an emotional link between wolf and pig. No precondition needed.\n\n4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Again, seeking help implies trust or friendship. So another positive magnitude for friendship, maybe 2.\n\n5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Same reasoning; the second pig trusts the third, so a positive friendship link with magnitude 2.\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.\n   - Driven by hunger or desire to eat them, not an emotional link. No precondition.\n\n7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n   - The third pig's action is defensive, likely motivated by fear or self-preservation. However, if we consider the pigs' friendship, they might be protecting each other, so a positive friendship link (maybe magnitude 3 for strong bond) among the pigs could be a precondition enabling them to work together.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action and add the preconditions as inferred.\n\nFor actions 2, 4, and 5, there are clear friendships that enable seeking help. For action 7, it's more about their collective safety, so a strong friendship bond makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

So, there's an existing tension of `life_at_risk` affecting him.\n\n3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.\n   - Similar to the first action, this puts the second pig's life at risk.\n\n4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Again, the first pig is in a situation where his life is still at risk, prompting him to seek help.\n\n5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - The second pig's life is now at risk after their house was destroyed.\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.\n   - At this point, all three pigs are in the brick house, and the wolf is trying to get to them, putting their lives at risk.\n\n7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n   - This action is a response to the ongoing tension where the wolf poses a threat to the pigs' lives.\n\nSo, for each action, I need to identify if there's an existing tension that serves as a precondition for the action to occur.\n\nLet me map this out:\n\n1. **blow_down_house** (wolf → first_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to first_pig\n\n2. **seek_help** (first_pig → second_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig\n\n3. **blow_down_house** (wolf → second_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to second_pig\n\n4. **seek_help** (first_pig → third_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting first_pig\n\n5. **seek_help** (second_pig → third_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting second_pig\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney** (wolf → third_pig)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk from wolf to all pigs\n\n7. **trap_enemy** (third_pig → wolf)\n   - Tension: life_at_risk affecting all pigs, prompting defensive action\n\nNow, I'll incorporate these tensions into the JSON structure under `preconditions` for each action.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"blow_down_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"first_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"seek_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"second_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attempt_enter_through_chimney\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"wolf\",\n    \"object\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"trap_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"third_pig\",\n    \"object\": \"wolf\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to identify postconditions for each action in the story analysis. Postconditions are changes resulting from the actions, affecting either emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they can't be the same as preconditions if those exist.\n\nLet me go through each action:\n\n1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down first_pig's house.\n   - This creates fear in the pig towards the wolf (negative emotional link).\n   - The tension of `life_at_risk` is now active for the pig.\n\n2. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from second_pig.\n   - This strengthens their friendship bond.\n   - The first pig's life remains at risk until they find safety.\n\n3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf blows down second_pig's house.\n   - Both pigs now have a stronger fear of the wolf (negative emotional links).\n   - Their lives are now more directly at risk.\n\n4. **seek_help**: First pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Strengthens friendship between first and third pigs.\n   - Life_at_risk tension continues until they reach safety.\n\n5. **seek_help**: Second pig seeks help from third_pig.\n   - Strengthens friendship between second and third pigs.\n   - Both pigs' lives remain at risk.\n\n6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf tries to enter through chimney.\n   - Increases the pigs' fear, strengthening negative emotional links towards the wolf.\n   - Life_at_risk tension escalates as the wolf gets closer.\n\n7. **trap_enemy**: Third pig traps wolf in boiling water.\n   - The pigs feel safer and more trusting among themselves (positive emotional links).\n   - Resolves the life_at_risk tension for all pigs, replacing it with life_normal.\n\nNow, I'll map these postconditions into the JSON structure under

Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent, especially regarding `n_characters`, preconditions, postconditions, and proper use of 'a' and 'b'. Also, I must make sure that no dead characters have ongoing emotional links or tensions. Each action should have at least one postcondition, which shouldn't be the same as any precondition.

Let me go through each action:

1. **blow_down_house**: Wolf (a) blows down first_pig's (b) house.
   - `n_characters` is 2, so both 'a' and 'b' are valid.
   - Precondition: life_at_risk from a to b.
   - Postcondition: Negative friendship link from b to a; tension remains.

2. **seek_help**: First_pig (a) seeks help from second_pig (b).
   - `n_characters` is 2, both ids valid.
   - Precondition: Friendship exists between a and b.
   - Postcondition: Strengthens their friendship bond further.

3. **blow_down_house**: Wolf (a) blows down second_pig's (b) house.
   - Similar to the first action; no issues here.

4. **seek_help**: First_pig (a) seeks help from third_pig (b).
   - `n_characters` is 2, both ids valid.
   - Precondition: Friendship exists between a and b.
   - Postcondition: Strengthens their friendship bond further.

5. **seek_help**: Second_pig (a) seeks help from third_pig (b).
   - Same as above; no issues.

6. **attempt_enter_through_chimney**: Wolf (a) tries to enter through chimney of third_pig (b).
   - `n_characters` is 2, both ids valid.
   - Precondition: life_at_risk from a to all pigs (*).
   - Postcondition: Intensifies negative emotional link towards wolf.

7. **trap_enemy**: Third_pig (a) traps wolf (b) in boiling water.
   - `n_characters` is 2, both ids valid.
   - Precondition: Strong friendship among pigs and life_at_risk tension.
   - Postcondition: Resolves life_at_risk to life_normal; prisoner_freed as wolf is no longer a threat.

I need to ensure that each action has at least one postcondition and that they don't mirror preconditions. Also, verify JSON syntax for correctness.

Now, I'll adjust the JSON accordingly to reflect these logical consistencies.
