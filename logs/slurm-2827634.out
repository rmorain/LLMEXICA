Story:  JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.

Now, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.

Starting from the beginning:

1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.
2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).
3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.
4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.
5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.
6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking her—another life_at_risk moment.
7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.
8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.
9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.

I need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.

Each action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.

Now, organizing them:

1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).
2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).
3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).
4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).
5. Jaguar prays for help (n_characters=1, subject only).
6. Enemy attacks Princess (life_at_risk).
7. Jaguar searches and fights enemy (life_at_risk, prisoner resolved).
8. Princess has mixed emotions (clashing_emotions).
9. Princess kills Jaguar (character_dead).
10. Princess dies (character_dead).

I think that covers all the key points without missing any tensions or emotional links.

time=2025-04-10T12:16:02.251-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.\n2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).\n3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.\n4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.\n5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking her—another life_at_risk moment.\n7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.\n8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.\n9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.\n\nI need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.\n\nEach action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.\n\nNow, organizing them:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).\n3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).\n4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).\n5.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a story about Jaguar Knight and Princess, and they want me to analyze it for emotional links and tensions. They've also given specific instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions related to these emotional links.

First, I need to understand what an "emotional link" is. From the problem statement, there are two types: friendship (platonic) and love (romantic). Each of these can have a magnitude from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, and positive values indicate affection or love.

Next, I need to identify "tensions" in the story. The tensions specified are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are events or situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.

Now, for each action in the story, I have to determine if there's a precondition related to an emotional link. A precondition is essentially why a character performs an action; it’s the motivation behind their behavior. For example, if Character A attacks Character B, the precondition might be that Character A feels hatred towards Character B.

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This is more of an event setting up the story. There's no direct emotional link here; it's just a plot device to put Jaguar Knight in danger. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.

2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Here, Princess acts to save Jaguar Knight because she cares about him. This suggests a positive emotional link of love with a magnitude that's at least moderate, say 2. So, the precondition is that Princess (the subject) has a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (the object).

3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: After being saved, Jaguar Knight feels gratitude towards Princess. This indicates a positive emotional link of friendship or love. The magnitude here could be around 2 as well.

4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping is an act that usually stems from negative emotions like hatred or revenge. So, the enemy must have a strong negative emotional link towards Princess, maybe a magnitude of -3 (hatred).

5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't directly involve another character, so there's no specific emotional link precondition here.

6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Again, attacking someone suggests a negative emotional link, probably hatred with a high magnitude (-3).

7. **Jaguar Knight searches for the enemy**: Jaguar Knight is motivated by his positive feelings towards Princess. This requires a strong emotional link of love, maybe around 2 or higher.

8. **Jaguar Knight fights the enemy**: Similar to searching, fighting to rescue someone indicates a strong positive emotional link towards the person being rescued (Princess), so love with magnitude 3.

9. **Princess feels conflicted**: This is an internal conflict where Princess has mixed emotions about Jaguar Knight. She loves him but hates his past actions. This creates a clash in her emotional links, hence "clashing_emotions" tension.

10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight and herself**: The ultimate tragic ending. For Princess to kill someone she loves, there must be an intense negative emotion towards something he did (his tattoo linked to her father's murder). So, her emotional link shifts from love (positive) to hatred (negative), with a high magnitude (-3).

In each case, I need to assign the type of emotional link, its magnitude, and specify which character is the source ('from') and target ('to'). This helps in understanding the motivation behind each action.

I also need to ensure that if there are no emotional links involved in an action, the preconditions array remains empty. For example, praying doesn't necessarily require a specific emotional link towards someone else unless it's specified.

By systematically going through each action and assigning these preconditions, I can build a comprehensive JSON structure that captures the motivations and emotions driving the characters' actions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.\n2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).\n3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.\n4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.\n5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking her—another life_at_risk moment.\n7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.\n8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.\n9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.\n\nI need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.\n\nEach action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.\n\nNow, organizing them:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).\n3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).\n4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).\n5. Jaguar prays for help (n_characters=1, subject only).\n6. Enemy attacks Princess (life_at_risk).\n7. Jaguar searches and fights enemy (life_at_risk, prisoner resolved).\n8. Princess has mixed emotions (clashing_emotions).\n9. Princess kills Jaguar (character_dead).\n10. Princess dies (character_dead).\n\nI think that covers all the key points without missing any tensions or emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"health_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"prisoner\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"clashing_emotions\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions, emotional links, and tensions in a structured format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

The user has provided a story about Jaguar Knight and Princess, and they want me to analyze it for emotional links and tensions. They've also given specific instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions related to these emotional links.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an \"emotional link\" is. From the problem statement, there are two types: friendship (platonic) and love (romantic). Each of these can have a magnitude from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, and positive values indicate affection or love.\n\nNext, I need to identify \"tensions\" in the story. The tensions specified are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are events or situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.\n\nNow, for each action in the story, I have to determine if there's a precondition related to an emotional link. A precondition is essentially why a character performs an action; it’s the motivation behind their behavior. For example, if Character A attacks Character B, the precondition might be that Character A feels hatred towards Character B.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This is more of an event setting up the story. There's no direct emotional link here; it's just a plot device to put Jaguar Knight in danger. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Here, Princess acts to save Jaguar Knight because she cares about him. This suggests a positive emotional link of love with a magnitude that's at least moderate, say 2. So, the precondition is that Princess (the subject) has a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (the object).\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: After being saved, Jaguar Knight feels gratitude towards Princess. This indicates a positive emotional link of friendship or love. The magnitude here could be around 2 as well.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping is an act that usually stems from negative emotions like hatred or revenge. So, the enemy must have a strong negative emotional link towards Princess, maybe a magnitude of -3 (hatred).\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't directly involve another character, so there's no specific emotional link precondition here.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Again, attacking someone suggests a negative emotional link, probably hatred with a high magnitude (-3).\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for the enemy**: Jaguar Knight is motivated by his positive feelings towards Princess. This requires a strong emotional link of love, maybe around 2 or higher.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights the enemy**: Similar to searching, fighting to rescue someone indicates a strong positive emotional link towards the person being rescued (Princess), so love with magnitude 3.\n\n9. **Princess feels conflicted**: This is an internal conflict where Princess has mixed emotions about Jaguar Knight. She loves him but hates his past actions. This creates a clash in her emotional links, hence \"clashing_emotions\" tension.\n\n10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight and herself**: The ultimate tragic ending. For Princess to kill someone she loves, there must be an intense negative emotion towards something he did (his tattoo linked to her father's murder). So, her emotional link shifts from love (positive) to hatred (negative), with a high magnitude (-3).\n\nIn each case, I need to assign the type of emotional link, its magnitude, and specify which character is the source ('from') and target ('to'). This helps in understanding the motivation behind each action.\n\nI also need to ensure that if there are no emotional links involved in an action, the preconditions array remains empty. For example, praying doesn't necessarily require a specific emotional link towards someone else unless it's specified.\n\nBy systematically going through each action and assigning these preconditions, I can build a comprehensive JSON structure that captures the motivations and emotions driving the characters' actions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the preconditions related to emotional links for each action, enhancing the understanding of character motivations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in this story. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to understand what a "tension" is in this context. From the problem statement, tensions include things like character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.

For each action, I need to determine if there's a precondition related to one of these tensions. A precondition here means that for an action to make sense, a certain tension must already exist. For example, if Character A rescues Character B, it might be because Character B is in a prisoner tension.

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This action leads to Jaguar Knight being injured. So, the precondition here is that there's a risk to his health, which falls under `health_at_risk`.

2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Princess acts because Jaguar Knight was badly injured and could die if not helped. So, the tension before this action is both `health_at_risk` and `life_at_risk`.

3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: This is more about emotional links rather than a tension precondition. No specific tension is required for him to feel gratitude.

4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping leads to Princess being held captive, so the precondition here is that she's now a `prisoner`.

5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't inherently require a tension precondition; it's more about seeking assistance.

6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Attacking her puts her life at risk, so the precondition is `life_at_risk`.

7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**: He's searching to rescue Princess because she's a prisoner and her life might be at risk. So, both `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` are preconditions here.

8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**: Fighting occurs in the context of rescuing Princess from captivity and potential danger, so again `prisoner` and `life_at_risk`.

9. **Princess feels conflicted**: Her internal conflict arises because she's torn between her love for Jaguar Knight and hatred towards his past actions. This creates a tension of `clashing_emotions`.

10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**: She kills him out of anger, which stems from the earlier `clashing_emotions` tension.

11. **Princess commits suicide**: After killing Jaguar Knight, her death is tragic, resulting in both characters being dead, so the tension here is `character_dead`.

I need to map these preconditions accurately for each action, ensuring that I correctly identify the type of tension and whether it applies to the subject or object of the action. If there are multiple tensions, I should list all of them.

Also, I have to remember that if there's no applicable tension precondition for an action, I leave the array empty. For example, praying doesn't inherently require a tension precondition unless specified.

By carefully analyzing each action and linking it to the appropriate tension, I can create a comprehensive JSON structure that outlines these preconditions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.\n2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).\n3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.\n4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.\n5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking her—another life_at_risk moment.\n7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.\n8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.\n9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.\n\nI need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.\n\nEach action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.\n\nNow, organizing them:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).\n3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).\n4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).\n5. Jaguar prays for help (n_characters=1, subject only).\n6. Enemy attacks Princess (life_at_risk).\n7. Jaguar searches and fights enemy (life_at_risk, prisoner resolved).\n8. Princess has mixed emotions (clashing_emotions).\n9. Princess kills Jaguar (character_dead).\n10. Princess dies (character_dead).\n\nI think that covers all the key points without missing any tensions or emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"health_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"prisoner\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"clashing_emotions\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions, emotional links, and tensions in a structured format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a story about Jaguar Knight and Princess, and they want me to analyze it for emotional links and tensions. They've also given specific instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions related to these emotional links.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an \"emotional link\" is. From the problem statement, there are two types: friendship (platonic) and love (romantic). Each of these can have a magnitude from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, and positive values indicate affection or love.\n\nNext, I need to identify \"tensions\" in the story. The tensions specified are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are events or situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.\n\nNow, for each action in the story, I have to determine if there's a precondition related to an emotional link. A precondition is essentially why a character performs an action; it’s the motivation behind their behavior. For example, if Character A attacks Character B, the precondition might be that Character A feels hatred towards Character B.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This is more of an event setting up the story. There's no direct emotional link here; it's just a plot device to put Jaguar Knight in danger. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Here, Princess acts to save Jaguar Knight because she cares about him. This suggests a positive emotional link of love with a magnitude that's at least moderate, say 2. So, the precondition is that Princess (the subject) has a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (the object).\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: After being saved, Jaguar Knight feels gratitude towards Princess. This indicates a positive emotional link of friendship or love. The magnitude here could be around 2 as well.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping is an act that usually stems from negative emotions like hatred or revenge. So, the enemy must have a strong negative emotional link towards Princess, maybe a magnitude of -3 (hatred).\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't directly involve another character, so there's no specific emotional link precondition here.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Again, attacking someone suggests a negative emotional link, probably hatred with a high magnitude (-3).\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for the enemy**: Jaguar Knight is motivated by his positive feelings towards Princess. This requires a strong emotional link of love, maybe around 2 or higher.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights the enemy**: Similar to searching, fighting to rescue someone indicates a strong positive emotional link towards the person being rescued (Princess), so love with magnitude 3.\n\n9. **Princess feels conflicted**: This is an internal conflict where Princess has mixed emotions about Jaguar Knight. She loves him but hates his past actions. This creates a clash in her emotional links, hence \"clashing_emotions\" tension.\n\n10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight and herself**: The ultimate tragic ending. For Princess to kill someone she loves, there must be an intense negative emotion towards something he did (his tattoo linked to her father's murder). So, her emotional link shifts from love (positive) to hatred (negative), with a high magnitude (-3).\n\nIn each case, I need to assign the type of emotional link, its magnitude, and specify which character is the source ('from') and target ('to'). This helps in understanding the motivation behind each action.\n\nI also need to ensure that if there are no emotional links involved in an action, the preconditions array remains empty. For example, praying doesn't necessarily require a specific emotional link towards someone else unless it's specified.\n\nBy systematically going through each action and assigning these preconditions, I can build a comprehensive JSON structure that captures the motivations and emotions driving the characters' actions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the preconditions related to emotional links for each action, enhancing the understanding of character motivations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"tension\" is in this context. From the problem statement, tensions include things like character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.\n\nFor each action, I need to determine if there's a precondition related to one of these tensions. A precondition here means that for an action to make sense, a certain tension must already exist. For example, if Character A rescues Character B, it might be because Character B is in a prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This action leads to Jaguar Knight being injured. So, the precondition here is that there's a risk to his health, which falls under `health_at_risk`.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Princess acts because Jaguar Knight was badly injured and could die if not helped. So, the tension before this action is both `health_at_risk` and `life_at_risk`.\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: This is more about emotional links rather than a tension precondition. No specific tension is required for him to feel gratitude.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping leads to Princess being held captive, so the precondition here is that she's now a `prisoner`.\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't inherently require a tension precondition; it's more about seeking assistance.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Attacking her puts her life at risk, so the precondition is `life_at_risk`.\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**: He's searching to rescue Princess because she's a prisoner and her life might be at risk. So, both `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` are preconditions here.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**: Fighting occurs in the context of rescuing Princess from captivity and potential danger, so again `prisoner` and `life_at_risk`.\n\n9. **Princess feels conflicted**: Her internal conflict arises because she's torn between her love for Jaguar Knight and hatred towards his past actions. This creates a tension of `clashing_emotions`.\n\n10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**: She kills him out of anger, which stems from the earlier `clashing_emotions` tension.\n\n11. **Princess commits suicide**: After killing Jaguar Knight, her death is tragic, resulting in both characters being dead, so the tension here is `character_dead`.\n\nI need to map these preconditions accurately for each action, ensuring that I correctly identify the type of tension and whether it applies to the subject or object of the action. If there are multiple tensions, I should list all of them.\n\nAlso, I have to remember that if there's no applicable tension precondition for an action, I leave the array empty. For example, praying doesn't inherently require a tension precondition unless specified.\n\nBy carefully analyzing each action and linking it to the appropriate tension, I can create a comprehensive JSON structure that outlines these preconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure identifies the preconditions related to tensions for each action, providing a clear understanding of the underlying conflicts and motivations in the narrative.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions.

Alright, so I need to identify postconditions for each action in this story. Postconditions are changes to emotional links or tensions caused by an action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and if there were preconditions, the postconditions can't be the same.

Let's start with the first action:

1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This leads to Jaguar Knight being injured, so it introduces a `health_at_risk` tension. There are no emotional links here, so the postcondition is just this tension.

2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Saving him likely strengthens their bond. So, Princess develops a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (love). Also, saving him resolves his health risk, introducing `health_normal`.

3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: Gratitude suggests he has a positive emotional link towards Princess.

4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: This creates a `prisoner` tension and puts her life at risk.

5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: No direct postconditions on emotional links or tensions, just seeking assistance.

6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Puts her life more at risk, so `life_at_risk`.

7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**: His determination might strengthen his emotional link towards Princess.

8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**: Fights to rescue her, which resolves the prisoner tension and life risk, introducing `prisoner_freed` and `life_normal`. Also strengthens his bond with her.

9. **Princess feels conflicted**: Her mixed emotions create a `clashing_emotions` tension.

10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**: This causes both characters to die, leading to `character_dead`.

11. **Princess commits suicide**: Results in her death, adding another `character_dead`.

For each action, I'll map these postconditions accordingly.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire story to get a good grasp of what happens. It involves Jaguar Knight, Princess, and several gods. The main events include a storm damaging a bridge, Jaguar getting injured, Princess saving him, Princess being kidnapped, Jaguar rescuing her, and then a tragic ending where both die.\n\nNow, focusing on emotional links: friendship and love. I should identify actions that show these between the characters. For tensions, the types are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The storm is caused by Tlaloc, damaging the bridge. This sets up a tension of health_at_risk when Jaguar tries to cross and gets injured.\n2. Princess knows Jaguar could die, showing concern (friendship or love). She uses a curative plant to save him, which resolves his health risk but establishes a strong emotional link (love).\n3. Jaguar realizes Princess saved his life, so his feelings for her might deepen, indicating mutual emotional links of love.\n4. The enemy kidnaps Princess, creating a prisoner tension and putting her life at risk.\n5. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n6. While captive, Princess is angry and confronts the enemy, leading to the enemy attacking her—another life_at_risk moment.\n7. Jaguar searches for the enemy, fights him, kills him, and frees Princess. This action resolves the prisoner tension but introduces a new conflict when Princess sees Jaguar's tattoo.\n8. The tattoo reminds Princess of her father's murder, causing clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar but hates his actions. This creates a tension of clashing_emotions.\n9. In the end, both characters die, leading to character_dead tensions.\n\nI need to list these events in chronological order as JSON objects with action, n_characters, subject, and object.\n\nEach action should be concise and avoid character names, using general terms. I'll make sure each entry reflects whether it's a friendship, love, or tension event and categorize the tension types accordingly.\n\nNow, organizing them:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health_at_risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar (love).\n3. Jaguar feels grateful (love).\n4. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner, life_at_risk).\n5. Jaguar prays for help (n_characters=1, subject only).\n6. Enemy attacks Princess (life_at_risk).\n7. Jaguar searches and fights enemy (life_at_risk, prisoner resolved).\n8. Princess has mixed emotions (clashing_emotions).\n9. Princess kills Jaguar (character_dead).\n10. Princess dies (character_dead).\n\nI think that covers all the key points without missing any tensions or emotional links.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"health_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"emotional_link\": \"love\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": [\"prisoner\", \"life_at_risk\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"tension\": \"life_at_risk\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"tension\": [\"life_at_risk\", \"prisoner\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"clashing_emotions\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"tension\": \"character_dead\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions, emotional links, and tensions in a structured format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a story about Jaguar Knight and Princess, and they want me to analyze it for emotional links and tensions. They've also given specific instructions on how to structure the JSON output with preconditions related to these emotional links.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an \"emotional link\" is. From the problem statement, there are two types: friendship (platonic) and love (romantic). Each of these can have a magnitude from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, and positive values indicate affection or love.\n\nNext, I need to identify \"tensions\" in the story. The tensions specified are character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are events or situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.\n\nNow, for each action in the story, I have to determine if there's a precondition related to an emotional link. A precondition is essentially why a character performs an action; it’s the motivation behind their behavior. For example, if Character A attacks Character B, the precondition might be that Character A feels hatred towards Character B.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This is more of an event setting up the story. There's no direct emotional link here; it's just a plot device to put Jaguar Knight in danger. So, preconditions related to emotional links would be empty.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Here, Princess acts to save Jaguar Knight because she cares about him. This suggests a positive emotional link of love with a magnitude that's at least moderate, say 2. So, the precondition is that Princess (the subject) has a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (the object).\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: After being saved, Jaguar Knight feels gratitude towards Princess. This indicates a positive emotional link of friendship or love. The magnitude here could be around 2 as well.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping is an act that usually stems from negative emotions like hatred or revenge. So, the enemy must have a strong negative emotional link towards Princess, maybe a magnitude of -3 (hatred).\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't directly involve another character, so there's no specific emotional link precondition here.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Again, attacking someone suggests a negative emotional link, probably hatred with a high magnitude (-3).\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for the enemy**: Jaguar Knight is motivated by his positive feelings towards Princess. This requires a strong emotional link of love, maybe around 2 or higher.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights the enemy**: Similar to searching, fighting to rescue someone indicates a strong positive emotional link towards the person being rescued (Princess), so love with magnitude 3.\n\n9. **Princess feels conflicted**: This is an internal conflict where Princess has mixed emotions about Jaguar Knight. She loves him but hates his past actions. This creates a clash in her emotional links, hence \"clashing_emotions\" tension.\n\n10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight and herself**: The ultimate tragic ending. For Princess to kill someone she loves, there must be an intense negative emotion towards something he did (his tattoo linked to her father's murder). So, her emotional link shifts from love (positive) to hatred (negative), with a high magnitude (-3).\n\nIn each case, I need to assign the type of emotional link, its magnitude, and specify which character is the source ('from') and target ('to'). This helps in understanding the motivation behind each action.\n\nI also need to ensure that if there are no emotional links involved in an action, the preconditions array remains empty. For example, praying doesn't necessarily require a specific emotional link towards someone else unless it's specified.\n\nBy systematically going through each action and assigning these preconditions, I can build a comprehensive JSON structure that captures the motivations and emotions driving the characters' actions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"friendship\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"love\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the preconditions related to emotional links for each action, enhancing the understanding of character motivations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"tension\" is in this context. From the problem statement, tensions include things like character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner, clashing_emotions, and love_competition. These are situations that create conflict or suspense in the narrative.\n\nFor each action, I need to determine if there's a precondition related to one of these tensions. A precondition here means that for an action to make sense, a certain tension must already exist. For example, if Character A rescues Character B, it might be because Character B is in a prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**: This action leads to Jaguar Knight being injured. So, the precondition here is that there's a risk to his health, which falls under `health_at_risk`.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Princess acts because Jaguar Knight was badly injured and could die if not helped. So, the tension before this action is both `health_at_risk` and `life_at_risk`.\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: This is more about emotional links rather than a tension precondition. No specific tension is required for him to feel gratitude.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: Kidnapping leads to Princess being held captive, so the precondition here is that she's now a `prisoner`.\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: This action doesn't inherently require a tension precondition; it's more about seeking assistance.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Attacking her puts her life at risk, so the precondition is `life_at_risk`.\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**: He's searching to rescue Princess because she's a prisoner and her life might be at risk. So, both `prisoner` and `life_at_risk` are preconditions here.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**: Fighting occurs in the context of rescuing Princess from captivity and potential danger, so again `prisoner` and `life_at_risk`.\n\n9. **Princess feels conflicted**: Her internal conflict arises because she's torn between her love for Jaguar Knight and hatred towards his past actions. This creates a tension of `clashing_emotions`.\n\n10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**: She kills him out of anger, which stems from the earlier `clashing_emotions` tension.\n\n11. **Princess commits suicide**: After killing Jaguar Knight, her death is tragic, resulting in both characters being dead, so the tension here is `character_dead`.\n\nI need to map these preconditions accurately for each action, ensuring that I correctly identify the type of tension and whether it applies to the subject or object of the action. If there are multiple tensions, I should list all of them.\n\nAlso, I have to remember that if there's no applicable tension precondition for an action, I leave the array empty. For example, praying doesn't inherently require a tension precondition unless specified.\n\nBy carefully analyzing each action and linking it to the appropriate tension, I can create a comprehensive JSON structure that outlines these preconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the enhanced JSON with preconditions related to tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_causes_bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_saves_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_feels_grateful\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnaps_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_prays_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_attacks_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"jaguar_knight_fights_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"-\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_feels_conflicted\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_kills_jaguar_knight\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_commits_suicide\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure identifies the preconditions related to tensions for each action, providing a clear understanding of the underlying conflicts and motivations in the narrative.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

There are no emotional links here, so the postcondition is just this tension.\n\n2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**: Saving him likely strengthens their bond. So, Princess develops a positive emotional link towards Jaguar Knight (love). Also, saving him resolves his health risk, introducing `health_normal`.\n\n3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**: Gratitude suggests he has a positive emotional link towards Princess.\n\n4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**: This creates a `prisoner` tension and puts her life at risk.\n\n5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**: No direct postconditions on emotional links or tensions, just seeking assistance.\n\n6. **Enemy attacks Princess**: Puts her life more at risk, so `life_at_risk`.\n\n7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**: His determination might strengthen his emotional link towards Princess.\n\n8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**: Fights to rescue her, which resolves the prisoner tension and life risk, introducing `prisoner_freed` and `life_normal`.

Okay, I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying that each action's n_characters aligns with its preconditions and postconditions. Also, after a character dies, they shouldn't have further emotional links or tensions.

Starting from the beginning:

1. **Storm causes bridge collapse**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No emotional links, only tension `health_at_risk`.
   - Consistent because no character IDs are referenced.

2. **Princess saves Jaguar Knight**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Preconditions include `emotional_links` from a to b.
   - Postconditions have both emotional links and tensions resolved (`health_normal`).
   - Emotional links from b to a in postconditions, which is okay as it's a different direction.

3. **Jaguar Knight feels grateful**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No preconditions; postconditions add an emotional link of friendship from a.
   - Since only one character, using 'a' is correct.

4. **Enemy kidnaps Princess**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Preconditions and postconditions correctly reference both characters as prisoner and life_at_risk.

5. **Jaguar Knight prays for help**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - No preconditions or postconditions related to emotional links, only seeking help.

6. **Enemy attacks Princess**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Postconditions add a negative emotional link from b to a and life_at_risk tension.
   - Consistent with the action's effect.

7. **Jaguar Knight searches for enemy**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - Emotional links from a, consistent as only one character involved.

8. **Jaguar Knight fights enemy**:
   - `n_characters` is 2.
   - Postconditions resolve prisoner and life_at_risk tensions with normal tensions.
   - Emotional link from a to b remains positive.

9. **Princess feels conflicted**:
   - `n_characters` is 1.
   - Introduces clashing_emotions tension without affecting emotional links.

10. **Princess kills Jaguar Knight**:
    - After this, both characters die, so no further actions should involve them.
    - Postconditions reflect character_dead tension and negative emotional link from a to b.

11. **Princess commits suicide**:
    - `n_characters` is 1.
    - Results in her death, adding another character_dead tension.

I need to ensure that once a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. Also, verify that 'a' refers to the subject and 'b' to the object consistently across all actions.
