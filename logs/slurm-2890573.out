Story:  n old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.

Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, "What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity." She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. "Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?" said she; "I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well."

"Be quiet, and do not weep," answered the frog, "I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?" "Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog," said she—"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing."

The frog answered, "I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again."

"Oh yes," said she, "I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again." She, however, thought, "How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!"

But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. "Wait, wait," said the frog. "Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst." But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.

The next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me." She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?" "Ah, no," replied she. "It is no giant but a disgusting frog."

"What does a frog want with thee?" "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."

In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,

"Princess! youngest princess!
Open the door for me!
Dost thou not know what thou saidst to me

Yesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?
Princess, youngest princess!
Open the door for me!"

Then said the King, "That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in." She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, "Lift me up beside thee." She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together." She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."

The King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, "He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee." So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father." Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. "Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog," said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."

"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well." Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:

When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together." She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."

The King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, "He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee." So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father." Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. "Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog," said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."

"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well." Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.

Alright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.

So, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.

First, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.

Tensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.

I'll go through each part of the story step by step.

1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.
2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.
3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)
4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).
5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.
6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.
7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.

Also, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.

Now, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.

Let me list them in order:

1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.
2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.
3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).
4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).
5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).
6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).
7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).
8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).
9. sits_together (both at table).
10. eats_together (shared action).
11. demands_lift (frog to princess).
12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).
13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).
14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).
15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).
16. transforms_into_prince.
17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.

Wait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.

I'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.

time=2025-04-16T09:59:52.036-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.\n\nAlso, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.\n\nNow, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.\n2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.\n3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).\n4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).\n5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).\n6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).\n7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).\n8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).\n9. sits_together (both at table).\n10. eats_together (shared action).\n11. demands_lift (frog to princess).\n12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).\n13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).\n14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).\n15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).\n16. transforms_into_prince.\n17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.\n\nWait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.\n\nI'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis of the story based on the identified emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions, while keeping the actions abstract and in chronological order.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.

First, I'll start with the first action: "cries".

1. **Action: cries**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).

3. **Action: promises_companionship**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.

4. **Action: brings_ball_back**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.

5. **Action: runs_away**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).

6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.

7. **Action: knocks_on_door**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.

8. **Action: opens_door**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.

9. **Action: sits_together**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.

10. **Action: eats_together**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.

11. **Action: demands_lift**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.

12. **Action: lifts**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).

13. **Action: asks_for_bed**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.

14. **Action: carries_upstairs**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.

15. **Action: throws_against_wall**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).

16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: -
    - n_characters: 1

    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.

17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**
    - Subject: Henry
    - Object: princess

    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.

Now, let me organize this into the required JSON format.

time=2025-04-16T10:01:02.677-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

<think>
Okay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.

Starting with the first action:

1. **Action: cries**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.

3. **Action: promises_companionship**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.

4. **Action: brings_ball_back**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.

5. **Action: runs_away**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.

6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.

7. **Action: knocks_on_door**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.

8. **Action: opens_door**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.

9. **Action: sits_together**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.

10. **Action: eats_together**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.

11. **Action: demands_lift**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.

12. **Action: lifts**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.

13. **Action: asks_for_bed**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.

14. **Action: carries_upstairs**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.

15. **Action: throws_against_wall**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.

16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: -
    - n_characters: 1

    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.

17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**
    - Subject: Henry
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.

time=2025-04-16T10:02:11.329-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.\n\nAlso, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.\n\nNow, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.\n2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.\n3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).\n4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).\n5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).\n6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).\n7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).\n8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).\n9. sits_together (both at table).\n10. eats_together (shared action).\n11. demands_lift (frog to princess).\n12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).\n13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).\n14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).\n15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).\n16. transforms_into_prince.\n17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.\n\nWait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.\n\nI'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis of the story based on the identified emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions, while keeping the actions abstract and in chronological order.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    -

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, this time identifying postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that result from the action, either altering an existing emotional link or resolving a tension.

Starting with the first action:

1. **Action: cries**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely intensifies her emotional state, but since there's no other character involved, there's no change in emotional links between characters. However, this could set up a tension where her emotional well-being is at risk.

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog offering help can positively affect the princess's emotional link towards him, possibly making her more grateful or positive. This could reduce any existing tensions related to her being upset.

3. **Action: promises_companionship**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   The princess agreeing to companionship might create a new emotional link, perhaps of cautious acceptance towards the frog. No immediate tension resolution here since the promise is just made.

4. **Action: brings_ball_back**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   Retrieving the ball likely reduces the princess's distress, resolving any `health_at_risk` tension from her crying earlier. Her emotional link might improve towards the frog due to his help.

5. **Action: runs_away**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: -
   - n_characters: 1

   The princess leaving without thanking the frog could create a negative emotional link towards him, possibly making the frog feel rejected or unappreciated.

6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   The frog arriving at the castle might introduce a new tension as the princess is now faced with keeping her promise, possibly feeling trapped or anxious.

7. **Action: knocks_on_door**
   - Subject: frog
   - Object: princess
   - n_characters: 2

   Knocking on the door could increase the princess's anxiety, maintaining or intensifying any existing tensions related to her obligation to the frog.

8. **Action: opens_door**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Opening the door might slightly reduce tension as communication is initiated, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the promise.

9. **Action: sits_together**
   - Subject: princess
   - Object: frog
   - n_characters: 2

   Sitting together could start to build a tentative emotional link between them, though it might be strained due to the circumstances.

10. **Action: eats_together**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Eating together might slightly improve their emotional link as they spend more time together, though the princess's reluctance could limit this effect.

11. **Action: demands_lift**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    The frog demanding to be lifted onto the table could create or intensify a negative emotional link from the princess towards him due to his persistence.

12. **Action: lifts**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Lifting the frog might not significantly change their emotional links unless it's done reluctantly, which could maintain or worsen the princess's negative feelings.

13. **Action: asks_for_bed**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    Asking to share her bed likely increases the princess's discomfort and anxiety, potentially creating a new tension related to her feeling trapped or violated.

14. **Action: carries_upstairs**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the situation without necessarily resolving any tensions; it might maintain the existing emotional links and tensions.

15. **Action: throws_against_wall**
    - Subject: princess
    - Object: frog
    - n_characters: 2

    Throwing the frog against the wall likely results in immediate resolution of tension as the frog is transformed into a prince, eliminating the `prisoner` status and any related risks.

16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**
    - Subject: frog
    - Object: -
    - n_characters: 1

    The transformation resolves all previous tensions related to the frog being a prisoner or any risks associated with his presence.

17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**
    - Subject: Henry
    - Object: princess
    - n_characters: 2

    Henry's heart cracking indicates ongoing emotional distress, so this action doesn't resolve any tensions but might highlight his loyalty and concern for the prince.

time=2025-04-16T10:03:45.115-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.\n\nAlso, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.\n\nNow, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.\n2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.\n3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).\n4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).\n5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).\n6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).\n7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).\n8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).\n9. sits_together (both at table).\n10. eats_together (shared action).\n11. demands_lift (frog to princess).\n12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).\n13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).\n14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).\n15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).\n16. transforms_into_prince.\n17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.\n\nWait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.\n\nI'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis of the story based on the identified emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions, while keeping the actions abstract and in chronological order.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, this time identifying postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that result from the action, either altering an existing emotional link or resolving a tension.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely intensifies her emotional state, but since there's no other character involved, there's no change in emotional links between characters. However, this could set up a tension where her emotional well-being is at risk.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offering help can positively affect the princess's emotional link towards him, possibly making her more grateful or positive. This could reduce any existing tensions related to her being upset.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess agreeing to companionship might create a new emotional link, perhaps of cautious acceptance towards the frog. No immediate tension resolution here since the promise is just made.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Retrieving the ball likely reduces the princess's distress, resolving any `health_at_risk` tension from her crying earlier. Her emotional link might improve towards the frog due to his help.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaving without thanking the frog could create a negative emotional link towards him, possibly making the frog feel rejected or unappreciated.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog arriving at the castle might introduce a new tension as the princess is now faced with keeping her promise, possibly feeling trapped or anxious.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Knocking on the door could increase the princess's anxiety, maintaining or intensifying any existing tensions related to her obligation to the frog.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door might slightly reduce tension as communication is initiated, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the promise.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together could start to build a tentative emotional link between them, though it might be strained due to the circumstances.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Eating together might slightly improve their emotional link as they spend more time together, though the princess's reluctance could limit this effect.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog demanding to be lifted onto the table could create or intensify a negative emotional link from the princess towards him due to his persistence.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog might not significantly change their emotional links unless it's done reluctantly, which could maintain or worsen the princess's negative feelings.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Asking to share her bed likely increases the princess's discomfort and anxiety, potentially creating a new tension related to her feeling trapped or violated.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the situation without necessarily resolving any tensions; it might maintain the existing emotional links and tensions.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall likely results in immediate resolution of tension as the frog is transformed into a prince, eliminating the `prisoner` status and any related risks.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation resolves all previous tensions related to the frog being a prisoner or any risks associated with his presence.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates ongoing emotional distress, so this action doesn't resolve any tensions but might highlight his loyalty and concern for the prince.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, let's go through each action one by one to ensure logical consistency. I'll check that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved, preconditions are not repeated in postconditions, emotional links are correctly typed, and all JSON syntax is correct.

1. **Action: cries**
   - n_characters: 1 (correct)
   - Preconditions: None
   - Postconditions:
     - Tensions: health_at_risk (since crying can indicate distress)

2. **Action: offers_help**
   - n_characters: 2 (frog and princess, correct)
   - Preconditions:
     - Emotional link: non-romantic, magnitude 1 from frog to princess

I made sure that each action adheres to the rules, ensuring `n_characters` matches the involved characters, no repetition between pre and post conditions, correct emotional link types, and proper JSON syntax.

time=2025-04-16T10:05:20.856-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.\n\nAlso, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.\n\nNow, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.\n2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.\n3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).\n4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).\n5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).\n6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).\n7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).\n8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).\n9. sits_together (both at table).\n10. eats_together (shared action).\n11. demands_lift (frog to princess).\n12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).\n13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).\n14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).\n15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).\n16. transforms_into_prince.\n17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.\n\nWait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.\n\nI'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis of the story based on the identified emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions, while keeping the actions abstract and in chronological order.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, this time identifying postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that result from the action, either altering an existing emotional link or resolving a tension.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely intensifies her emotional state, but since there's no other character involved, there's no change in emotional links between characters. However, this could set up a tension where her emotional well-being is at risk.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offering help can positively affect the princess's emotional link towards him, possibly making her more grateful or positive. This could reduce any existing tensions related to her being upset.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess agreeing to companionship might create a new emotional link, perhaps of cautious acceptance towards the frog. No immediate tension resolution here since the promise is just made.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Retrieving the ball likely reduces the princess's distress, resolving any `health_at_risk` tension from her crying earlier. Her emotional link might improve towards the frog due to his help.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaving without thanking the frog could create a negative emotional link towards him, possibly making the frog feel rejected or unappreciated.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog arriving at the castle might introduce a new tension as the princess is now faced with keeping her promise, possibly feeling trapped or anxious.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Knocking on the door could increase the princess's anxiety, maintaining or intensifying any existing tensions related to her obligation to the frog.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door might slightly reduce tension as communication is initiated, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the promise.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together could start to build a tentative emotional link between them, though it might be strained due to the circumstances.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Eating together might slightly improve their emotional link as they spend more time together, though the princess's reluctance could limit this effect.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog demanding to be lifted onto the table could create or intensify a negative emotional link from the princess towards him due to his persistence.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog might not significantly change their emotional links unless it's done reluctantly, which could maintain or worsen the princess's negative feelings.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Asking to share her bed likely increases the princess's discomfort and anxiety, potentially creating a new tension related to her feeling trapped or violated.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the situation without necessarily resolving any tensions; it might maintain the existing emotional links and tensions.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall likely results in immediate resolution of tension as the frog is transformed into a prince, eliminating the `prisoner` status and any related risks.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation resolves all previous tensions related to the frog being a prisoner or any risks associated with his presence.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates ongoing emotional distress, so this action doesn't resolve any tensions but might highlight his loyalty and concern for the prince.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's go through each action one by one to ensure logical consistency. I'll check that `n_characters` matches the number of characters involved, preconditions are not repeated in postconditions, emotional links are correctly typed, and all JSON syntax is correct.\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - n_characters: 1 (correct)\n   - Preconditions: None\n   - Postconditions:\n     - Tensions: health_at_risk (since crying can indicate distress)\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n

health_normal\n\nI made sure that each action adheres to the rules, ensuring `n_characters` matches the involved characters, no repetition between pre and post conditions, correct emotional link types, and proper JSON syntax.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

<think>
Okay, I need to address the issue where some actions don't have any postconditions, which is required. The user specified that each action must have at least one postcondition; otherwise, it should be removed.

First, I'll go through each of the problematic actions and see if I can infer appropriate postconditions:

1. **Action: offers_help**
   - The frog helps the princess retrieve her ball.
   - Postcondition: The princess develops a positive emotional link towards the frog because he helped her.

2. **Action: runs_away**
   - The princess leaves without thanking the frog.
   - Postcondition: The frog might feel rejected, creating a negative emotional link from the frog to the princess.

3. **Action: opens_door**
   - The princess opens the door for the frog.
   - Postcondition: This action could slightly improve their relationship, so an emotional link of cautious trust might develop.

4. **Action: lifts**
   - The princess reluctantly lifts the frog onto the table.
   - Postcondition: Her negative feelings towards him might intensify due to her reluctance.

5. **Action: carries_upstairs**
   - She carries the frog upstairs.
   - Postcondition: This close interaction could lead to a slight improvement in their emotional link, perhaps less negative.

If I can't find suitable postconditions for these actions, they should be removed from the JSON object. However, I'll try to infer logical postconditions based on the story's context.

After considering each action, I realize that all of them have potential postconditions related to emotional links or tensions. Therefore, I will update the JSON to include these postconditions.

time=2025-04-16T10:06:31.236-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince. This action releases the romantic emotional link as they realize their connection.\n\nAlso, Faithful Henry's heart cracks indicate health_at_risk tension due to his grief.\n\nNow, I need to map these into actions with subjects and objects, focusing on the types specified.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. cries (princess) - emotional link non-romantic.\n2. offers_help (frog to princess) - non-romantic link.\n3. promises_companionship (princess to frog).\n4. brings_ball_back (frog to princess).\n5. runs_away (princess, ignoring frog).\n6. arrives_at_castle (frog to princess).\n7. knocks_on_door (frog to princess).\n8. opens_door (princess to frog reluctantly).\n9. sits_together (both at table).\n10. eats_together (shared action).\n11. demands_lift (frog to princess).\n12. lifts (princess to frog, reluctantly).\n13. asks_for_bed (frog to princess).\n14. carries_upstairs (princess to frog).\n15. throws_against_wall (princess to frog).\n16. transforms_into_prince.\n17. hears_heart_cracking (Henry) - health_at_risk.\n\nWait, some of these might not fit the exact action definitions or may need simplification. Also, I should ensure each action is abstract enough, using snake_case without specific names.\n\nI'll structure each action with subject, object, and n_characters, ensuring that the actions are in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis of the story based on the identified emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions, while keeping the actions abstract and in chronological order.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, this time identifying postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that result from the action, either altering an existing emotional link or resolving a tension.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely intensifies her emotional state, but since there's no other character involved, there's no change in emotional links between characters. However, this could set up a tension where her emotional well-being is at risk.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offering help can positively affect the princess's emotional link towards him, possibly making her more grateful or positive. This could reduce any existing tensions related to her being upset.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess agreeing to companionship might create a new emotional link, perhaps of cautious acceptance towards the frog. No immediate tension resolution here since the promise is just made.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Retrieving the ball likely reduces the princess's distress, resolving any `health_at_risk` tension from her crying earlier. Her emotional link might improve towards the frog due to his help.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaving without thanking the frog could create a negative emotional link towards him, possibly making the frog feel rejected or unappreciated.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog arriving at the castle might introduce a new tension as the princess is now faced with keeping her promise, possibly feeling trapped or anxious.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Knocking on the door could increase the princess's anxiety, maintaining or intensifying any existing tensions related to her obligation to the frog.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door might slightly reduce tension as communication is initiated, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the promise.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together could start to build a tentative emotional link between them, though it might be strained due to the circumstances.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Eating together might slightly improve their emotional link as they spend more time together, though the princess's reluctance could limit this effect.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog demanding to be lifted onto the table could create or intensify a negative emotional link from the princess towards him due to his persistence.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog might not significantly change their emotional links unless it's done reluctantly, which could maintain or worsen the princess's negative feelings.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Asking to share her bed likely increases the princess's discomfort and anxiety, potentially creating a new tension related to her feeling trapped or violated.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the situation without necessarily resolving any tensions; it might maintain the existing emotional links and tensions.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall likely results in immediate resolution of tension as the frog is transformed into a prince, eliminating the `prisoner` status and any related risks.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation resolves all previous tensions related to the frog being a prisoner or any risks associated with his presence.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates ongoing emotional distress, so this action doesn't resolve any tensions but might highlight his loyalty and concern for the prince.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's go through each action one by one to ensure logical consistency.

<think>
Alright, I need to address the issue where two actions have emotional links but are missing either a subject or an object. The user pointed out that 'runs_away' and 'transforms_into_prince' have this problem.

First, let's look at 'runs_away':

- **Action: runs_away**
  - Subject: princess
  - Object: -
  - n_characters: 1

  This action only involves the princess. Since emotional links require both a subject and an object referring to characters, I should remove the problematic emotional link from this action.

Next, 'transforms_into_prince':

- **Action: transforms_into_prince**
  - Subject: frog
  - Object: -
  - n_characters: 1

  This action only involves the frog transforming into a prince. The emotional link here is towards the princess, but since she's not directly involved in this specific action, it's problematic to include her as an object. Therefore, I should remove the emotional link from this action.

I'll update the JSON by removing these emotional links and ensuring that only actions with valid subject-object pairs have emotional links.

time=2025-04-16T10:07:36.233-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the story again first.\n\nSo, the story is about a princess who loses her golden ball down a well. A frog helps her retrieve it in exchange for promises of companionship. She agrees but doesn't take it seriously until the frog shows up at the castle. The king makes her keep her promise, and eventually, the frog turns into a prince after she throws him against the wall in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to identify actions that relate to emotional links between characters. Emotional links can be non-romantic or romantic. Looking through the story, the princess's interaction with the frog starts off as reluctant but later becomes forced companionship. The frog's persistence and her eventual acceptance hint at a developing emotional link, which turns romantic when he transforms into a prince.\n\nTensions in the story involve the princess being upset about losing her ball (emotional distress), the frog's life being at risk if he couldn't retrieve the ball, the princess's reluctance leading to the frog being a prisoner in the well until she agrees. Also, when the frog comes to the castle, there's tension as the princess is scared and the king enforces her promise.\n\nI'll go through each part of the story step by step.\n\n1. The princess loses her golden ball into the well. She cries because she can't retrieve it. This is an emotional link (non-romantic) with herself, showing distress.\n2. The frog offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link between them, as he's asking to be her friend.\n3. After retrieving the ball, the princess runs away, ignoring the frog's plea. This shows tension (life_at_risk or prisoner? Maybe not directly. It's more about breaking a promise.)\n4. The next day, the frog arrives at the castle and asks to be let in. The princess is frightened, which introduces tension (prisoner as he's outside wanting in).\n5. The king forces her to let him in, so she does. This shows the emotional link changing, though reluctantly.\n6. The frog follows her to dinner, asking to sit with her, eat together, etc. These actions build on their forced companionship, an emotional link.\n7. Eventually, when he asks to sleep in her bed, she throws him against the wall, and he transforms into a prince.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the first action: \"cries\".\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely stems from her emotional distress due to losing something precious. Since there's no other character involved, the emotional link here is within herself. However, since we're focusing on links between characters, and this action doesn't involve another character directly, I think the `emotional_links` array should be empty.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog is offering to help the princess retrieve her ball in exchange for companionship. For the frog to offer help, he must have some positive emotional link towards the princess. Since it's not romantic at this point, I'll classify it as 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of 1 (liking).\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess promises companionship to the frog in exchange for her ball. At this point, she's desperate and doesn't have any particular emotional link with the frog. So, I think there are no significant emotional links here.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball for the princess. This action is a result of their agreement, so it doesn't necessarily require an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links are needed.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess runs away without thanking the frog or keeping her promise. This indicates that she doesn't have a positive emotional link towards the frog, perhaps even a negative one. So, I'll set an emotional link of 'non-romantic' with a magnitude of -2 (dislike).\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog shows up at the castle to remind the princess of her promise. This action is driven by his desire for companionship, indicating a positive emotional link towards her. So, 'non-romantic' with magnitude 1.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocks on the door to get the princess's attention. This is a continuation of his desire for companionship, so it maintains the same emotional link as before.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess reluctantly opens the door. She might have mixed feelings about letting the frog in, but there's no strong emotional link indicated here. So, no preconditions needed.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess and the frog sit together at her table. This is a result of the king's command, not necessarily an emotional link. Therefore, no preconditions related to emotional links.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    They eat together, but it's clear that the princess is not enjoying this. She does it out of obligation rather than any emotional connection. So, no significant preconditions.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to be lifted onto the table. This action is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily require an emotional link beyond what's already established.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The princess reluctantly lifts the frog. Her reluctance suggests a negative emotional link, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -1 (dislike).\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asks to sleep in her bed. This is part of their agreement and doesn't indicate a new emotional link.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    She carries him upstairs, still reluctantly. No significant change in emotional links here.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    In frustration, she throws the frog against the wall. This action is driven by her strong dislike towards him, so 'non-romantic' with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The frog turns into a prince. This is a transformation and doesn't involve an emotional link at this point.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Faithful Henry's heart cracks due to his grief over the prince being a frog. This indicates a strong 'non-romantic' bond of loyalty and love, so magnitude 3.\n\nNow, let me organize this into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"offers_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"brings_ball_back\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"arrives_at_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sits_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eats_together\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"demands_lift\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"lifts\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -1,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"asks_for_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"carries_upstairs\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"frog\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"frog\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"hears_heart_cracking\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Henry\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Tensions can be one of four types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This situation doesn't directly involve any of the defined tensions like someone being a prisoner or their life at risk. So, no tensions here.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offers to help retrieve the ball. There's no immediate tension unless the princess's distress counts as `health_at_risk`, but that might be stretching it. I think there are no significant tensions here.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for his help. This is more about an agreement rather than a tension precondition.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog retrieves the ball. The only possible tension here is that if he couldn't retrieve it, the princess's emotional state might be at risk, but again, not directly a defined tension.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaves without thanking the frog. This action doesn't inherently involve any of the specified tensions.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog comes to the castle to remind her of the promise. This creates a tension because the princess is now in a situation where she has to deal with the frog's demands, which could be seen as `prisoner` if he's insisting on staying.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog knocking on the door can be seen as creating a `prisoner` tension since he's seeking entry and companionship, which feels confining to the princess.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door doesn't inherently introduce a new tension beyond what already exists from the previous action.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together might not directly relate to any of the defined tensions unless their interaction causes emotional distress, but that's more about emotional links than tensions.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Similar to sitting together, eating together doesn't inherently introduce a tension unless it's causing the princess significant stress, which could fall under `health_at_risk`.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to be lifted onto the table is part of their agreement and doesn't necessarily introduce a new tension.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog again is part of the ongoing interaction, not introducing new tensions.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog asking to share her bed creates a significant tension, as it can be seen as a `prisoner` situation where he's imposing on her personal space.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the tension established earlier.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall introduces a `life_at_risk` tension because it's a violent action that could harm him.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation doesn't inherently involve any of the defined tensions.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates `health_at_risk` due to his emotional distress over the prince's situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, so I need to go through each action in the story again, this time identifying postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that result from the action, either altering an existing emotional link or resolving a tension.\n\nStarting with the first action:\n\n1. **Action: cries**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess is crying because she lost her golden ball. This action likely intensifies her emotional state, but since there's no other character involved, there's no change in emotional links between characters. However, this could set up a tension where her emotional well-being is at risk.\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog offering help can positively affect the princess's emotional link towards him, possibly making her more grateful or positive. This could reduce any existing tensions related to her being upset.\n\n3. **Action: promises_companionship**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The princess agreeing to companionship might create a new emotional link, perhaps of cautious acceptance towards the frog. No immediate tension resolution here since the promise is just made.\n\n4. **Action: brings_ball_back**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Retrieving the ball likely reduces the princess's distress, resolving any `health_at_risk` tension from her crying earlier. Her emotional link might improve towards the frog due to his help.\n\n5. **Action: runs_away**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: -\n   - n_characters: 1\n\n   The princess leaving without thanking the frog could create a negative emotional link towards him, possibly making the frog feel rejected or unappreciated.\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   The frog arriving at the castle might introduce a new tension as the princess is now faced with keeping her promise, possibly feeling trapped or anxious.\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   - Subject: frog\n   - Object: princess\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Knocking on the door could increase the princess's anxiety, maintaining or intensifying any existing tensions related to her obligation to the frog.\n\n8. **Action: opens_door**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Opening the door might slightly reduce tension as communication is initiated, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issue of the promise.\n\n9. **Action: sits_together**\n   - Subject: princess\n   - Object: frog\n   - n_characters: 2\n\n   Sitting together could start to build a tentative emotional link between them, though it might be strained due to the circumstances.\n\n10. **Action: eats_together**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Eating together might slightly improve their emotional link as they spend more time together, though the princess's reluctance could limit this effect.\n\n11. **Action: demands_lift**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    The frog demanding to be lifted onto the table could create or intensify a negative emotional link from the princess towards him due to his persistence.\n\n12. **Action: lifts**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Lifting the frog might not significantly change their emotional links unless it's done reluctantly, which could maintain or worsen the princess's negative feelings.\n\n13. **Action: asks_for_bed**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Asking to share her bed likely increases the princess's discomfort and anxiety, potentially creating a new tension related to her feeling trapped or violated.\n\n14. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Carrying the frog upstairs continues the situation without necessarily resolving any tensions; it might maintain the existing emotional links and tensions.\n\n15. **Action: throws_against_wall**\n    - Subject: princess\n    - Object: frog\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Throwing the frog against the wall likely results in immediate resolution of tension as the frog is transformed into a prince, eliminating the `prisoner` status and any related risks.\n\n16. **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n    - Subject: frog\n    - Object: -\n    - n_characters: 1\n\n    The transformation resolves all previous tensions related to the frog being a prisoner or any risks associated with his presence.\n\n17. **Action: hears_heart_cracking**\n    - Subject: Henry\n    - Object: princess\n    - n_characters: 2\n\n    Henry's heart cracking indicates ongoing emotional distress, so this action doesn't resolve any tensions but might highlight his loyalty and concern for the prince.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's go through each action one by one to ensure logical consistency.

**Action: cries**\n   - n_characters: 1 (correct)\n   - Preconditions: None\n   - Postconditions:\n     - Tensions: health_at_risk (since crying can indicate distress)\n\n2. **Action: offers_help**\n   - n_characters: 2 (frog and princess, correct)\n   - Preconditions:\n     - Emotional link: non-romantic, magnitude 1 from frog to princess\n   - Postconditions:\n     - Emotional links remain

link: non-romantic, magnitude -2 from princess to frog\n   - Postconditions:\n     - No emotional links or tensions added\n\n6. **Action: arrives_at_castle**\n   - n_characters: 2 (frog and princess, correct)\n   - Preconditions:\n     - Emotional link: non-romantic, magnitude 1 from frog to princess\n   - Postconditions:\n     - Tension introduced: prisoner\n\n7. **Action: knocks_on_door**\n   -

health_normal\n\nI made sure that each action adheres to the rules, ensuring `n_characters` matches the involved characters, no repetition between pre and post conditions, correct emotional link types, and proper JSON syntax.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

The user specified that each action must have at least one postcondition; otherwise, it should be removed.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each of the problematic actions and see if I can infer appropriate postconditions:\n\n1. **Action: offers_help**\n   - The frog helps the princess retrieve her ball.\n   - Postcondition: The princess develops a positive emotional link towards the frog because he helped her.\n\n2. **Action: runs_away**\n   - The princess leaves without thanking the frog.\n   - Postcondition: The frog might feel rejected, creating a negative emotional link from the frog to the princess.\n\n3. **Action: opens_door**\n   - The princess opens the door for the frog.\n   - Postcondition: This action could slightly improve their relationship, so an emotional link of cautious trust might develop.\n\n4. **Action: lifts**\n   - The princess reluctantly lifts the frog onto the table.\n   - Postcondition: Her negative feelings towards him might intensify due to her reluctance.\n\n5. **Action: carries_upstairs**\n   - She carries the frog upstairs.\n   - Postcondition: This close interaction could lead to a slight improvement in their emotional link, perhaps less negative.\n\nIf I can't find suitable postconditions for these actions, they should be removed from the JSON object. However, I'll try to infer logical postconditions based on the story's context.\n\nAfter considering each action, I realize that all of them have potential postconditions related to emotional links or tensions. Therefore, I will update the JSON to include these postconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\":

The user pointed out that 'runs_away' and 'transforms_into_prince' have this problem.\n\nFirst, let's look at 'runs_away':\n\n- **Action: runs_away**\n  - Subject: princess\n  - Object: -\n  - n_characters: 1\n\n  This action only involves the princess. Since emotional links require both a subject and an object referring to characters, I should remove the problematic emotional link from this action.\n\nNext, 'transforms_into_prince':\n\n- **Action: transforms_into_prince**\n  - Subject: frog\n  - Object: -\n  - n_characters: 1\n\n  This action only involves the frog transforming into a prince. The emotional link here is towards the princess, but since she's not directly involved in this specific action, it's problematic to include her as an object. Therefore, I should remove the emotional link from this action.\n\nI'll update the JSON by removing these emotional links and ensuring that only actions with valid subject-object pairs have emotional links.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cries\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\":

Alright, I need to address the JSON error related to the 'from' key. It seems that the previous JSON might have had a syntax issue or incorrect data type for the 'from' value.

Upon reviewing, I realize that the 'from' and 'to' keys should only use 'a', 'b', '-', or '*' as values. In some parts of the JSON, these keys might have been assigned incorrectly, causing the error.

I'll go through each action to ensure that 'from' and 'to' are correctly set with valid values. I'll also check for any missing commas or brackets that could cause syntax errors.

After verification, I'll correct any inconsistencies and ensure the JSON is well-formatted.
