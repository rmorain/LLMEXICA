Story:  Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, "I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother."

"Does she live far off?" said the wolf

"Oh I say," answered Little Red Riding Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."

"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

"Who's there?"

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me."

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"

"All the better to hug you with, my dear."

"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"

"All the better to run with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see with, my child."

"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.

"All the better to eat you up with."

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.

He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.

Next, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.

Then, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.

After that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.

Finally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.

So I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.

time=2025-04-16T10:10:45.211-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.

Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.

Starting with "cares_for" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.

Similarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.

When the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.

LRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.

Wolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.

When Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.

Wolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.

When LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.

Finally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.

I need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.\n\nStarting with \"cares_for\" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.\n\nSimilarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.\n\nWhen the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.\n\nLRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.\n\nWhen Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.\n\nWolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWhen LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.\n\nFinally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.\n\nI need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\":

Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time focusing on identifying or inferring preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. 

I'll start by looking at each action and determining if any tension exists that must be in place for the action to occur.

1. **cares_for**: This is about emotional bonds, so no tension here.
2. **sends_on_errand**: Again, this is more about trust, not directly related to tension.
3. **communicates_with**: Just talking, no inherent tension unless specified.
4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf is curious but not yet a threat, so no tension.
5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares her plans innocently; no tension here.
6. **decides_to_deceive**: This implies the wolf has malicious intent, which could relate to `life_at_risk` for both Grandmother and LRRH since he plans to eat them.
7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf pretending to be LRRH, leading to danger, so `health_at_risk` or `life_at_risk` for Grandmother.
8. **falls_ill**: Directly indicates `health_at_risk`.
9. **hides_identity**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, putting her in danger, so `health_at_risk`.
10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, risking her life, so `life_at_risk`.
11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in `character_dead` for Grandmother.
12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf is waiting to attack LRRH, so `life_at_risk` for both.
13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to the disguised wolf, tension of `life_at_risk`.
14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH senses danger, implying `life_at_risk`.
15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases tension as LRRH realizes something's wrong.
16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his true intent, leading to immediate `life_at_risk` for LRRH.
17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in `character_dead` for LRRH.

I'll map these tensions to each action, ensuring that where a tension is a prerequisite, it's correctly noted as such.

time=2025-04-16T10:12:31.436-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.\n\nStarting with \"cares_for\" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.\n\nSimilarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.\n\nWhen the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.\n\nLRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.\n\nWhen Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.\n\nWolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWhen LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.\n\nFinally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.\n\nI need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\":

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that happen as a result of the action, and they can either be emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required for each action.

I'll start by analyzing each action one by one:

1. **cares_for**: This indicates an increase in positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH. So, I'll note a non-romantic emotional link with increased magnitude.

2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar to above, trust is built, so another positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH.

3. **communicates_with**: Since LRRH talks to Wolf, there's no immediate change in emotional links unless it's negative due to future events. But since she doesn't know the danger yet, maybe a slight decrease or none.

4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf shows interest, which might create suspicion but not an immediate emotional link change.

5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares details with Wolf, possibly increasing trust on her side, so positive towards Wolf, but since he's deceptive, it could later turn negative.

6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf plans to trick Grandmother and LRRH, creating a negative emotional link from Wolf to both.

7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf tricks Grandmother, leading to her harm, so a decrease in trust from Grandmother towards Wolf if she knew, but since she doesn't, maybe a slight negative link after the action.

8. **falls_ill**: Grandmother's health is already at risk, so this might increase concern from LRRH and Mother, creating stronger emotional bonds.

9. **hides_identity**: Deception leads to harm, so negative emotional links towards Wolf from Grandmother and LRRH once they realize.

10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets Wolf in, leading to her death, so a significant decrease in trust if she had known, but as she doesn't, it's more about the tension of life at risk.

11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in Grandmother's death, creating a permanent negative emotional link from LRRH and Mother towards Wolf.

12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting to attack increases the tension of life at risk for LRRH.

13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, so slight trust but later turns to fear.

14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, leading to a negative emotional link towards the disguised Wolf.

15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases suspicion and fear, solidifying negative links towards Wolf.

16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming the negative emotional links and increasing the tension of life at risk.

17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in LRRH's death, creating a permanent negative link from Mother towards Wolf.

For each action, I'll map these changes, ensuring that postconditions reflect the outcomes accurately without repeating preconditions unless necessary.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.\n\nStarting with \"cares_for\" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.\n\nSimilarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.\n\nWhen the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.\n\nLRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.\n\nWhen Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.\n\nWolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWhen LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.\n\nFinally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.\n\nI need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time focusing on identifying or inferring preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. \n\nI'll start by looking at each action and determining if any tension exists that must be in place for the action to occur.\n\n1. **cares_for**: This is about emotional bonds, so no tension here.\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Again, this is more about trust, not directly related to tension.\n3. **communicates_with**: Just talking, no inherent tension unless specified.\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf is curious but not yet a threat, so no tension.\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares her plans innocently; no tension here.\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: This implies the wolf has malicious intent, which could relate to `life_at_risk` for both Grandmother and LRRH since he plans to eat them.\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf pretending to be LRRH, leading to danger, so `health_at_risk` or `life_at_risk` for Grandmother.\n8. **falls_ill**: Directly indicates `health_at_risk`.\n9. **hides_identity**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, putting her in danger, so `health_at_risk`.\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, risking her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in `character_dead` for Grandmother.\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf is waiting to attack LRRH, so `life_at_risk` for both.\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to the disguised wolf, tension of `life_at_risk`.\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH senses danger, implying `life_at_risk`.\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases tension as LRRH realizes something's wrong.\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his true intent, leading to immediate `life_at_risk` for LRRH.\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in `character_dead` for LRRH.\n\nI'll map these tensions to each action, ensuring that where a tension is a prerequisite, it's correctly noted as such.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that happen as a result of the action, and they can either be emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required for each action.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each action one by one:\n\n1. **cares_for**: This indicates an increase in positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH. So, I'll note a non-romantic emotional link with increased magnitude.\n\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar to above, trust is built, so another positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH.\n\n3. **communicates_with**: Since LRRH talks to Wolf, there's no immediate change in emotional links unless it's negative due to future events. But since she doesn't know the danger yet, maybe a slight decrease or none.\n\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf shows interest, which might create suspicion but not an immediate emotional link change.\n\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares details with Wolf, possibly increasing trust on her side, so positive towards Wolf, but since he's deceptive, it could later turn negative.\n\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf plans to trick Grandmother and LRRH, creating a negative emotional link from Wolf to both.\n\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf tricks Grandmother, leading to her harm, so a decrease in trust from Grandmother towards Wolf if she knew, but since she doesn't, maybe a slight negative link after the action.\n\n8. **falls_ill**: Grandmother's health is already at risk, so this might increase concern from LRRH and Mother, creating stronger emotional bonds.\n\n9. **hides_identity**: Deception leads to harm, so negative emotional links towards Wolf from Grandmother and LRRH once they realize.\n\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets Wolf in, leading to her death, so a significant decrease in trust if she had known, but as she doesn't, it's more about the tension of life at risk.\n\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in Grandmother's death, creating a permanent negative emotional link from LRRH and Mother towards Wolf.\n\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting to attack increases the tension of life at risk for LRRH.\n\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, so slight trust but later turns to fear.\n\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, leading to a negative emotional link towards the disguised Wolf.\n\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases suspicion and fear, solidifying negative links towards Wolf.\n\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming the negative emotional links and increasing the tension of life at risk.\n\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in LRRH's death, creating a permanent negative link from Mother towards Wolf.\n\nFor each action, I'll map these changes, ensuring that postconditions reflect the outcomes accurately

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to ensure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent, especially regarding the number of characters involved (`n_characters`) and how they're referenced in preconditions and postconditions.

First, for actions where `n_characters` is 1, like "decides_to_deceive" or "hides_in_bed", I need to make sure that only 'a' is used since there's no 'b'. This means any emotional links or tensions should only involve the subject ('a').

Next, if a character dies in an action ("eats_up"), I must ensure that they don't appear in any subsequent preconditions or postconditions. For example, after Grandmother is eaten, she shouldn't be part of any further actions.

I also need to check that emotional links in postconditions aren't the same as those in preconditions unless it's a change (like increasing or decreasing magnitude). Romantic links should only exist if there's actual romantic context; otherwise, they're non-romantic.

Actions must have at least one postcondition. If I can't identify any logical effect from an action, I might need to remove that action altogether.

Let me go through each action:

1. **cares_for**: Both 'a' and 'b' are involved, so emotional links make sense.
2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar setup; trust is built between two characters.
3. **communicates_with**: No immediate emotional impact, but maybe slight trust initially.
4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf's curiosity could hint at future tension but not yet an effect.
5. **reveals_information**: LRRH unknowingly provides crucial info to Wolf, leading to deception.
6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf alone planning, so only 'a' involved; increases negative links towards others.
7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, leading to her harm.
8. **falls_ill**: Directly about Grandmother's health, no emotional link needed here.
9. **hides_identity**: Wolf impersonates LRRH, affecting both Grandmother and LRRH negatively.
10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, leading to her death.
11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.
12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting for LRRH increases tension without emotional links.
13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, slight trust but turns negative.
14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, creating a negative link towards Wolf.
15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases fear and solidifies negative links.
16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming negative links and increasing tension.
17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.

I'll adjust each action to ensure `n_characters` matches the involved characters, remove any same preconditions/postconditions, and verify that only 'a' is used when there's one character. I'll also ensure dead characters don't appear after their demise.

time=2025-04-16T10:14:54.974-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.\n\nStarting with \"cares_for\" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.\n\nSimilarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.\n\nWhen the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.\n\nLRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.\n\nWhen Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.\n\nWolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWhen LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.\n\nFinally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.\n\nI need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time focusing on identifying or inferring preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. \n\nI'll start by looking at each action and determining if any tension exists that must be in place for the action to occur.\n\n1. **cares_for**: This is about emotional bonds, so no tension here.\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Again, this is more about trust, not directly related to tension.\n3. **communicates_with**: Just talking, no inherent tension unless specified.\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf is curious but not yet a threat, so no tension.\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares her plans innocently; no tension here.\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: This implies the wolf has malicious intent, which could relate to `life_at_risk` for both Grandmother and LRRH since he plans to eat them.\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf pretending to be LRRH, leading to danger, so `health_at_risk` or `life_at_risk` for Grandmother.\n8. **falls_ill**: Directly indicates `health_at_risk`.\n9. **hides_identity**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, putting her in danger, so `health_at_risk`.\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, risking her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in `character_dead` for Grandmother.\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf is waiting to attack LRRH, so `life_at_risk` for both.\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to the disguised wolf, tension of `life_at_risk`.\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH senses danger, implying `life_at_risk`.\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases tension as LRRH realizes something's wrong.\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his true intent, leading to immediate `life_at_risk` for LRRH.\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in `character_dead` for LRRH.\n\nI'll map these tensions to each action, ensuring that where a tension is a prerequisite, it's correctly noted as such.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that happen as a result of the action, and they can either be emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required for each action.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each action one by one:\n\n1. **cares_for**: This indicates an increase in positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH. So, I'll note a non-romantic emotional link with increased magnitude.\n\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar to above, trust is built, so another positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH.\n\n3. **communicates_with**: Since LRRH talks to Wolf, there's no immediate change in emotional links unless it's negative due to future events. But since she doesn't know the danger yet, maybe a slight decrease or none.\n\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf shows interest, which might create suspicion but not an immediate emotional link change.\n\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares details with Wolf, possibly increasing trust on her side, so positive towards Wolf, but since he's deceptive, it could later turn negative.\n\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf plans to trick Grandmother and LRRH, creating a negative emotional link from Wolf to both.\n\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf tricks Grandmother, leading to her harm, so a decrease in trust from Grandmother towards Wolf if she knew, but since she doesn't, maybe a slight negative link after the action.\n\n8. **falls_ill**: Grandmother's health is already at risk, so this might increase concern from LRRH and Mother, creating stronger emotional bonds.\n\n9. **hides_identity**: Deception leads to harm, so negative emotional links towards Wolf from Grandmother and LRRH once they realize.\n\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets Wolf in, leading to her death, so a significant decrease in trust if she had known, but as she doesn't, it's more about the tension of life at risk.\n\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in Grandmother's death, creating a permanent negative emotional link from LRRH and Mother towards Wolf.\n\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting to attack increases the tension of life at risk for LRRH.\n\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, so slight trust but later turns to fear.\n\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, leading to a negative emotional link towards the disguised Wolf.\n\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases suspicion and fear, solidifying negative links towards Wolf.\n\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming the negative emotional links and increasing the tension of life at risk.\n\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in LRRH's death, creating a permanent negative link from Mother towards Wolf.\n\nFor each action, I'll map these changes, ensuring that postconditions reflect the outcomes accurately without repeating preconditions unless necessary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to ensure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent, especially regarding the number of characters involved (`n_characters`) and how they're referenced in preconditions and postconditions.\n\nFirst, for actions where `n_characters` is 1, like \"decides_to_deceive\" or \"hides_in_bed\", I need to make sure that only 'a' is used since there's no 'b'. This means any emotional links or tensions should only involve the subject ('a').\n\nNext, if a character dies in an action (\"eats_up\"), I must ensure that they don't appear in any subsequent preconditions or postconditions. For example, after Grandmother is eaten, she shouldn't be part of any further actions.\n\nI also need to check that emotional links in postconditions aren't the same as those in preconditions unless it's a change (like increasing or decreasing magnitude). Romantic links should only exist if there's actual romantic context; otherwise, they're non-romantic.\n\nActions must have at least one postcondition. If I can't identify any logical effect from an action, I might need to remove that action altogether.\n\nLet me go through each action:\n\n1. **cares_for**: Both 'a' and 'b' are involved, so emotional links make sense.\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar setup; trust is built between two characters.\n3. **communicates_with**: No immediate emotional impact, but maybe slight trust initially.\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf's curiosity could hint at future tension but not yet an effect.\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH unknowingly provides crucial info to Wolf, leading to deception.\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf alone planning, so only 'a' involved; increases negative links towards others.\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, leading to her harm.\n8. **falls_ill**: Directly about Grandmother's health, no emotional link needed here.\n9. **hides_identity**: Wolf impersonates LRRH, affecting both Grandmother and LRRH negatively.\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, leading to her death.\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting for LRRH increases tension without emotional links.\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, slight trust but turns negative.\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, creating a negative link towards Wolf.\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases fear and solidifies negative links.\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming negative links and increasing tension.\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.\n\nI'll adjust each action to ensure `n_characters` matches the involved characters, remove any same preconditions/postconditions, and verify that only 'a' is used when there's one character. I'll also ensure dead characters don't appear after their demise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n

Okay, so I need to fix this JSON object by addressing the actions that have emotional links but are missing a proper `subject` or `object`. The problematic actions identified are 'decides_to_deceive' and 'notices_something_unusual'. 

First, let me look at 'decides_to_deceive'. In the original JSON, it's set with "n_characters": 1, which means only the subject ('a') is involved. However, in the postconditions, there's an emotional link from 'a' to 'b', implying that 'b' should be the object. But since this action is about Wolf deciding to deceive, and he doesn't have a direct object here, it might not make sense to have an emotional link without knowing who 'b' is. So, I think it's better to remove the problematic emotional link here.

Next, 'notices_something_unusual' has "n_characters": 1, meaning only LRRH is involved. The postconditions include an emotional link from 'a' to 'b', but since there's no object specified, this could be confusing. It might make more sense that LRRH feels suspicious towards the wolf, so setting the object to 'Wolf' and updating "n_characters" to 2 would fix this.

So, for 'decides_to_deceive', I'll remove the emotional link because there's no clear object. For 'notices_something_unusual', I'll set the object to 'Wolf' and adjust "n_characters" accordingly.

Let me go through each action:

1. **cares_for (Mother)**: Both subject and object are present, so it's fine.
2. **cares_for (Grandmother)**: Same as above.
3. **sends_on_errand**: Both characters involved, okay.
4. **communicates_with**: Both present, no issue.
5. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Both present, okay.
6. **reveals_information**: Both present, fine.
7. **decides_to_deceive**: Remove emotional link as there's no object.
8. **knocks_on_door**: Both characters, okay.
9. **falls_ill**: Only subject, no emotional links, fine.
10. **hides_identity**: Both characters, okay.
11. **enters_unknowingly**: Both present, fine.
12. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Both present, no issue.
13. **hides_in_bed**: Only Wolf, okay.
14. **communicates_with (again)**: Both present, fine.
15. **notices_something_unusual**: Update to include 'Wolf' as object and set "n_characters": 2.
16. **comments_on_appearance**: Both present, okay.
17. **reveals_true_identity**: Only Wolf, no emotional links, fine.
18. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Both present, okay.

By making these adjustments, the JSON should be logically consistent with proper `subject` and `object` values where necessary.

time=2025-04-16T10:16:08.500-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\n\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, \"I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.\"\n\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the wolf\n\n\"Oh I say,\" answered Little Red Riding Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"\n\nThe wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.\"\n\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nThe wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, \"It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.\"\n\nThe wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\n\nThe wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, \"Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, \"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big legs you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to run with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big ears you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hear with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to see with, my child.\"\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you up with.\"\n\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this story of Little Red Riding Hood and extract the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the beginning talks about Little Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother being very fond of her. So there are strong non-romantic emotional bonds here. The mother sends her on an errand, which shows trust and care. That's an action involving two characters: the mother as subject and LRRH as object.\n\nNext, LRRH meets the wolf in the forest. She tells him about visiting her grandmother, so that's communication between them. Since she doesn't know the danger, it's just a conversation without any emotional link yet.\n\nThen, the wolf decides to go see the grandmother first. He arrives and knocks on the door. The grandmother is ill, which introduces a health risk tension. When the wolf impersonates LRRH, that's deception, leading to the wolf entering and eating the grandmother. This creates a character dead tension.\n\nAfter that, the wolf hides in bed, expecting LRRH. She comes later, they communicate again, but this time she notices his big features. Each comment about his appearance is an action where she's noticing something different, indicating suspicion or fear.\n\nFinally, the wolf reveals himself and eats her, which introduces another character dead tension.\n\nSo I'll list these actions in order, focusing on emotional links (non-romantic) between LRRH and her mother/grandmother, and tensions like health at risk, life at risk, and character dead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sends_on_errand\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"asks_about_whereabouts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_information\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"decides_to_deceive\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"falls_ill\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_unknowingly\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Grandmother\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Grandmother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"hides_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"communicates_with\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"notices_something_unusual\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"comments_on_appearance\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\",\n        \"object\": \"Wolf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"reveals_true_identity\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eats_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Wolf\",\n        \"object\": \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and figure out the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3. The goal is to see what emotional connections must exist for each character to perform their actions.\n\nStarting with \"cares_for\" between Mother and Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH). It makes sense that the mother has strong positive feelings towards LRRH since she's excessively fond of her. So, I'll assign a non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH with a magnitude of 3.\n\nSimilarly, when Grandmother dotes on LRRH even more, it’s another non-romantic emotional link, but perhaps slightly stronger. Maybe a magnitude of 3 as well.\n\nWhen the mother sends LRRH on an errand, she must trust her, indicating a positive non-romantic link from Mother to LRRH. So, another precondition with magnitude 2.\n\nLRRH talking to the wolf doesn't require any specific emotional link because she doesn’t know him yet. But when Wolf decides to deceive Grandmother, he probably has negative feelings towards LRRH, so a non-romantic link of magnitude -3 from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWolf knocking on the door and hiding his identity implies he wants to eat Grandmother, so he must have negative feelings towards her too. So, another non-romantic link from Wolf to Grandmother with magnitude -3.\n\nWhen Grandmother unknowingly lets Wolf in, she trusts him thinking he's LRRH. So, a positive non-romantic link from Grandmother to LRRH with magnitude 2.\n\nWolf eating Grandmother and then hiding shows his intention to eat LRRH next, so another negative link from Wolf to LRRH.\n\nWhen LRRH notices something unusual about the wolf, she feels suspicious, indicating a negative link towards the wolf. So, non-romantic link from LRRH to Wolf with magnitude -2.\n\nFinally, when Wolf reveals himself and eats her, he must have strong negative feelings towards both Grandmother and LRRH. So, two preconditions here: one towards Grandmother and another towards LRRH, both with magnitude -3.\n\nI need to make sure each precondition is correctly assigned from the source (subject) to the target (object). Also, if an action doesn’t require any emotional link, I leave it empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story again, but this time focusing on identifying or inferring preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. \n\nI'll start by looking at each action and determining if any tension exists that must be in place for the action to occur.\n\n1. **cares_for**: This is about emotional bonds, so no tension here.\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Again, this is more about trust, not directly related to tension.\n3. **communicates_with**: Just talking, no inherent tension unless specified.\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf is curious but not yet a threat, so no tension.\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares her plans innocently; no tension here.\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: This implies the wolf has malicious intent, which could relate to `life_at_risk` for both Grandmother and LRRH since he plans to eat them.\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf pretending to be LRRH, leading to danger, so `health_at_risk` or `life_at_risk` for Grandmother.\n8. **falls_ill**: Directly indicates `health_at_risk`.\n9. **hides_identity**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, putting her in danger, so `health_at_risk`.\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, risking her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in `character_dead` for Grandmother.\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf is waiting to attack LRRH, so `life_at_risk` for both.\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to the disguised wolf, tension of `life_at_risk`.\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH senses danger, implying `life_at_risk`.\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases tension as LRRH realizes something's wrong.\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his true intent, leading to immediate `life_at_risk` for LRRH.\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in `character_dead` for LRRH.\n\nI'll map these tensions to each action, ensuring that where a tension is a prerequisite, it's correctly noted as such.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer the postconditions related to both emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that happen as a result of the action, and they can either be emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required for each action.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each action one by one:\n\n1. **cares_for**: This indicates an increase in positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH. So, I'll note a non-romantic emotional link with increased magnitude.\n\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar to above, trust is built, so another positive emotional link from Mother to LRRH.\n\n3. **communicates_with**: Since LRRH talks to Wolf, there's no immediate change in emotional links unless it's negative due to future events. But since she doesn't know the danger yet, maybe a slight decrease or none.\n\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf shows interest, which might create suspicion but not an immediate emotional link change.\n\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH shares details with Wolf, possibly increasing trust on her side, so positive towards Wolf, but since he's deceptive, it could later turn negative.\n\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf plans to trick Grandmother and LRRH, creating a negative emotional link from Wolf to both.\n\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf tricks Grandmother, leading to her harm, so a decrease in trust from Grandmother towards Wolf if she knew, but since she doesn't, maybe a slight negative link after the action.\n\n8. **falls_ill**: Grandmother's health is already at risk, so this might increase concern from LRRH and Mother, creating stronger emotional bonds.\n\n9. **hides_identity**: Deception leads to harm, so negative emotional links towards Wolf from Grandmother and LRRH once they realize.\n\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets Wolf in, leading to her death, so a significant decrease in trust if she had known, but as she doesn't, it's more about the tension of life at risk.\n\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in Grandmother's death, creating a permanent negative emotional link from LRRH and Mother towards Wolf.\n\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting to attack increases the tension of life at risk for LRRH.\n\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, so slight trust but later turns to fear.\n\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, leading to a negative emotional link towards the disguised Wolf.\n\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases suspicion and fear, solidifying negative links towards Wolf.\n\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming the negative emotional links and increasing the tension of life at risk.\n\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in LRRH's death, creating a permanent negative link from Mother towards Wolf.\n\nFor each action, I'll map these changes, ensuring that postconditions reflect the outcomes accurately without repeating preconditions unless necessary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to ensure that each action in the JSON is logically consistent, especially regarding the number of characters involved (`n_characters`) and how they're referenced in preconditions and postconditions.\n\nFirst, for actions where `n_characters` is 1, like \"decides_to_deceive\" or \"hides_in_bed\", I need to make sure that only 'a' is used since there's no 'b'. This means any emotional links or tensions should only involve the subject ('a').\n\nNext, if a character dies in an action (\"eats_up\"), I must ensure that they don't appear in any subsequent preconditions or postconditions. For example, after Grandmother is eaten, she shouldn't be part of any further actions.\n\nI also need to check that emotional links in postconditions aren't the same as those in preconditions unless it's a change (like increasing or decreasing magnitude). Romantic links should only exist if there's actual romantic context; otherwise, they're non-romantic.\n\nActions must have at least one postcondition. If I can't identify any logical effect from an action, I might need to remove that action altogether.\n\nLet me go through each action:\n\n1. **cares_for**: Both 'a' and 'b' are involved, so emotional links make sense.\n2. **sends_on_errand**: Similar setup; trust is built between two characters.\n3. **communicates_with**: No immediate emotional impact, but maybe slight trust initially.\n4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Wolf's curiosity could hint at future tension but not yet an effect.\n5. **reveals_information**: LRRH unknowingly provides crucial info to Wolf, leading to deception.\n6. **decides_to_deceive**: Wolf alone planning, so only 'a' involved; increases negative links towards others.\n7. **knocks_on_door**: Wolf deceives Grandmother, leading to her harm.\n8. **falls_ill**: Directly about Grandmother's health, no emotional link needed here.\n9. **hides_identity**: Wolf impersonates LRRH, affecting both Grandmother and LRRH negatively.\n10. **enters_unknowingly**: Grandmother lets in the wolf, leading to her death.\n11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.\n12. **hides_in_bed**: Wolf waiting for LRRH increases tension without emotional links.\n13. **communicates_with (again)**: LRRH talks to Wolf, not knowing it's him, slight trust but turns negative.\n14. **notices_something_unusual**: LRRH becomes suspicious, creating a negative link towards Wolf.\n15. **comments_on_appearance**: Each comment increases fear and solidifies negative links.\n16. **reveals_true_identity**: Wolf shows his intent, confirming negative links and increasing tension.\n17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Results in her death, ending her involvement.\n\nI'll adjust each action to ensure `n_characters` matches the involved characters, remove any same preconditions/postconditions, and verify that only 'a' is used when there's one character. I'll also ensure dead characters don't appear after their demise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cares_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"Mother\",\n

JSON object to include the correct `subject` or `object` values for these actions and update `n_characters` appropriately. If after review, there are no reasonable direct or indirect objects to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the JSON object. Make sure to wrap the JSON object in ```json``` tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this JSON object by addressing the actions that have emotional links but are missing a proper `subject` or `object`. The problematic actions identified are 'decides_to_deceive' and 'notices_something_unusual'. \n\nFirst, let me look at 'decides_to_deceive'. In the original JSON, it's set with \"n_characters\": 1, which means only the subject ('a') is involved. However, in the postconditions, there's an emotional link from 'a' to 'b', implying that 'b' should be the object. But since this action is about Wolf deciding to deceive, and he doesn't have a direct object here, it might not make sense to have an emotional link without knowing who 'b' is. So, I think it's better to remove the problematic emotional link here.\n\nNext, 'notices_something_unusual' has \"n_characters\": 1, meaning only LRRH is involved. The postconditions include an emotional link from 'a' to 'b', but since there's no object specified, this could be confusing. It might make more sense that LRRH feels suspicious towards the wolf, so setting the object to 'Wolf' and updating \"n_characters\" to 2 would fix this.\n\nSo, for 'decides_to_deceive', I'll remove the emotional link because there's no clear object. For 'notices_something_unusual', I'll set the object to 'Wolf' and adjust \"n_characters\" accordingly.\n\nLet me go through each action:\n\n1. **cares_for (Mother)**: Both subject and object are present, so it's fine.\n2. **cares_for (Grandmother)**: Same as above.\n3. **sends_on_errand**: Both characters involved, okay.\n4. **communicates_with**: Both present, no issue.\n5. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Both present, okay.\n6. **reveals_information**: Both present, fine.\n7. **decides_to_deceive**: Remove emotional link as there's no object.\n8. **knocks_on_door**: Both characters, okay.\n9. **falls_ill**: Only subject, no emotional links, fine.\n10. **hides_identity**: Both characters, okay.\n11. **enters_unknowingly**: Both present, fine.\n12. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Both present, no issue.\n13. **hides_in_bed**: Only Wolf, okay.\n14. **communicates_with (again)**: Both present, fine.\n15. **notices_something_unusual**: Update to include 'Wolf' as object and set \"n_characters\": 2.\n16. **comments_on_appearance**: Both present, okay.\n17. **reveals_true_identity**: Only Wolf, no emotional links, fine.\n18. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Both present, okay.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the JSON should be logically consistent with proper `subject` and `object` values where necessary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\":

Alright, so I've got this JSON object that was generated earlier, and it's throwing an error related to 'preconditions'. The user mentioned that when they tried to extract data from the previous response, they encountered an issue with the key `'preconditions'`. My task is to regenerate the JSON object to correct this error.

First, I need to understand what exactly caused the error. Since the error message is just `''preconditions''`, it's a bit vague, but I can make some educated guesses. Possible issues could be:

1. **Missing Key**: The 'preconditions' key might not be present in all actions, leading to errors when trying to access it.
2. **Syntax Error**: There could be a syntax issue in the JSON structure related to 'preconditions', such as missing commas or incorrect brackets.
3. **Invalid Data Type**: The value assigned to 'preconditions' might not be an object as expected.

Looking back at the previous JSON, each action had both 'preconditions' and 'postconditions'. Perhaps during regeneration, one of these keys was omitted or incorrectly formatted in some actions, causing the error when parsing.

To fix this, I'll need to ensure that every action has both 'preconditions' and 'postconditions' properly defined. Even if they don't have any preconditions or postconditions, the keys should still be present with appropriate default values (like empty arrays).

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **cares_for**: Ensure both 'preconditions' and 'postconditions' exist.
2. **sends_on_errand**: Same as above.
3. **communicates_with**: Make sure 'preconditions' is present, even if it's empty.
4. **asks_about_whereabouts**: Verify the structure under 'tensions'.
5. **reveals_information**: Check for correct formatting in both sections.
6. **decides_to_deceive**: Ensure that after removing emotional links, 'postconditions' are correctly set.
7. **knocks_on_door**: Confirm all keys are present and properly formatted.
8. **falls_ill**: Make sure it's structured correctly without emotional links.
9. **hides_identity**: Check for consistency in both sections.
10. **enters_unknowingly**: Ensure all keys are present.
11. **eats_up (Grandmother)**: Verify the structure, especially since it results in a character death.
12. **hides_in_bed**: Make sure 'preconditions' is correctly formatted.
13. **communicates_with (again)**: Ensure both sections are complete.
14. **notices_something_unusual**: After updating to include 'Wolf', check the JSON structure.
15. **comments_on_appearance**: Confirm all keys are present and correct.
16. **reveals_true_identity**: Make sure it's properly formatted without emotional links.
17. **eats_up (LRRH)**: Verify that this action is correctly structured, especially regarding the character death.

I'll also ensure that there are no trailing commas, which can cause JSON parsing errors. Each key should have the correct data type; for example, 'emotional_links' and 'tensions' should be arrays, even if they're empty.

Additionally, I'll make sure that string values are enclosed in double quotes and that all objects are properly closed with braces.

After carefully reviewing each action and ensuring the JSON structure is valid, I'll regenerate the JSON object to correct the error.
