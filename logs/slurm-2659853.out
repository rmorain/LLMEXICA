Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, from what I know, the sun usually rises in the east and sets in the west because of how the Earth rotates. The Earth spins from west to east, which is why we see the sun moving across the sky that way. But wait, are there any exceptions or special cases where this might not be true?

Maybe if you're near the poles? I've heard something about the Midnight Sun in places like northern Norway or Alaska. During summer solstice, the sun can stay visible all day, so maybe it doesn't set, but does that mean it rises in a different direction? Or perhaps during certain times of the year when the days are really long, the sunrise and sunset points shift a bit.

Another thought: what about other planets? Do they have different sunrise directions? But the question is specifically about Earth. Also, maybe if you're on a different planet or moon, the rotation could cause the sun to rise in the west, but again, that's not relevant here.

Wait, are there any mythological or cultural references where the sun is said to rise in the west? I think in some religious texts or stories, there might be metaphors about the sun rising in the west as a sign of something significant, like the end times. But that's probably symbolic and not literal.

Also, considering astronomy, sometimes celestial events can make it look like the sun is behaving unusually, but I don't think any natural event would cause the sun to actually rise in the west on Earth. Maybe during an eclipse or something, but even then, the direction wouldn't change; it's just the light that's affected.

Could there be a situation where the rotation of the Earth changes? Like if the Earth's axis shifted drastically due to some cataclysmic event, maybe the poles could shift and cause the sun to rise in different directions. But as far as I know, such an event hasn't happened recently or predictably soon, so for now, the sun rises in the east.

Wait a second, there's also the concept of the Earth's axial precession, which is like a slow wobble over thousands of years. This affects the position of the North Star but does it change where the sun rises? I don't think so; it would just shift the constellations we see over time, not the cardinal directions of sunrise and sunset.

So putting all that together: normally, no, the sun doesn't rise in the west on Earth. The only exceptions might be near the poles during certain times of extreme daylight, but even then, it's more about the sun not setting rather than rising in the west. So I think the answer is no.

No

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, I need to analyze the story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through the story again.

First, Jaguar_Knight and Princess are inhabitants of Tenochtitlan. Tlaloc sends a storm that damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. So, that's an action where the bridge collapses, injuring him. The subject here is the storm (indirect), so maybe the object is Jaguar_Knight.

Princess knows he could die and acts to save him by using a curative plant. She prepares plasma and applies it, which works. That shows friendship or love from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.

Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved his life, indicating gratitude or friendship. Then, Enemy kidnaps Princess for revenge because her father humiliated them. Enemy ties her up in the forest to kill her at midnight. So, Enemy is a prisoner here, and there's a life_at_risk tension.

Jaguar decides to rescue her, prays for wisdom, finds Enemy after searching, attacks him with a dagger, throws dust, perforates his chest, takes his heart. That's several actions related to rescuing Princess, so liberation. Then Jaguar frees Princess, showing bravery and leading to admiration, which is a friendship or love action.

Princess had fallen in love but then sees Jaguar's tattoo, similar to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his past actions. She feels ambivalent, leading to odium. Then she kills Jaguar and herself, resulting in both characters dead.

So, the tensions here include life_at_risk (Jaguar injured), prisoner (Princess kidnapped), love_competition? Wait, no. It's more clashing_emotions because Princess has conflicting feelings towards Jaguar. Also, health_at_risk when Jaguar is injured.

Actions to extract: bridge collapse, apply curative plasma, decide rescue, liberate, recognize tattoo, feel ambivalent, cut jugular, bleed to death, kill self.

Each action needs subject and object, n_characters. For example, bridge_collapse has no subject, just object as Jaguar. Apply_curative_plasma is Princess (subject) helping Jaguar (object). Recognize_tattoo is Princess realizing about Jaguar.

Tensions identified: life_at_risk (Jaguar's injury), prisoner (Princess captured), clashing_emotions (Princess's conflicting feelings), and character_dead when both die at the end. Also, health_at_risk for Jaguar initially.

Emotional links are friendship from Princess saving Jaguar, love as Princess falls in love, then turns to odio due to tattoo, creating clashing emotions.

Here is the structured JSON output based on the analysis:

```

This JSON captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions. Each action is simplified for reusability and includes relevant subject and object details.

time=2025-04-02T10:43:02.996-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the story and extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through the story again.\n\nFirst, Jaguar_Knight and Princess are inhabitants of Tenochtitlan. Tlaloc sends a storm that damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. So, that's an action where the bridge collapses, injuring him. The subject here is the storm (indirect), so maybe the object is Jaguar_Knight.\n\nPrincess knows he could die and acts to save him by using a curative plant. She prepares plasma and applies it, which works. That shows friendship or love from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved his life, indicating gratitude or friendship. Then, Enemy kidnaps Princess for revenge because her father humiliated them. Enemy ties her up in the forest to kill her at midnight. So, Enemy is a prisoner here, and there's a life_at_risk tension.\n\nJaguar decides to rescue her, prays for wisdom, finds Enemy after searching, attacks him with a dagger, throws dust, perforates his chest, takes his heart. That's several actions related to rescuing Princess, so liberation. Then Jaguar frees Princess, showing bravery and leading to admiration, which is a friendship or love action.\n\nPrincess had fallen in love but then sees Jaguar's tattoo, similar to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his past actions. She feels ambivalent, leading to odium. Then she kills Jaguar and herself, resulting in both characters dead.\n\nSo, the tensions here include life_at_risk (Jaguar injured), prisoner (Princess kidnapped), love_competition? Wait, no. It's more clashing_emotions because Princess has conflicting feelings towards Jaguar. Also, health_at_risk when Jaguar is injured.\n\nActions to extract: bridge collapse, apply curative plasma, decide rescue, liberate, recognize tattoo, feel ambivalent, cut jugular, bleed to death, kill self.\n\nEach action needs subject and object, n_characters. For example, bridge_collapse has no subject, just object as Jaguar. Apply_curative_plasma is Princess (subject) helping Jaguar (object). Recognize_tattoo is Princess realizing about Jaguar.\n\nTensions identified: life_at_risk (Jaguar's injury), prisoner (Princess captured), clashing_emotions (Princess's conflicting feelings), and character_dead when both die at the end. Also, health_at_risk for Jaguar initially.\n\nEmotional links are friendship from Princess saving Jaguar, love as Princess falls in love, then turns to odio due to tattoo, creating clashing emotions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured JSON output based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"bridge_collapse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"apply_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_life_saved\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"decide_rescue\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"feel_ambivalent_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"bleed_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill_self\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions, focusing on emotional links and tensions.

Alright, I need to convert the given JSON structure into the Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) format as per the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what exactly is required.

First, I recall that the DPS format includes a story name followed by a sequence of actions. Each action can have an optional subject and object character. The example provided shows that each line represents an action, with the subject performing the action on the object if applicable.

Looking at the JSON data, it's a list of actions with details about the subject, object, and the number of characters involved. My task is to translate these into DPS format lines where each action is a string that may include the subject and object.

I'll go through each action in the JSON:

1. "bridge_collapse" with no subject and Jaguar_Knight as object.
2. "apply_curative_plasma" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight.
3. "realize_life_saved" by Jaguar_Knight with no object.
4. "kidnap_prisoner" by Enemy on Princess.
5. "decide_rescue" by Jaguar_Knight with no object.
6. "pray_for_wisdom" by Jaguar_Knight with no object.
7. "attack_enemy" by Jaguar_Knight on Enemy.
8. "liberate_prisoner" by Jaguar_Knight on Princess.
9. "recognize_tattoo" by Princess with no object.
10. "feel_ambivalent_emotions" by Princess with no object.
11. "cut_jugular" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight.
12. "bleed_to_death" by Jaguar_Knight with no object.
13. "kill_self" by Princess with no object.

For each of these, I need to create a DPS line. If an action has both subject and object, the format would be "Subject Action Object". If there's only a subject or only an object, it'll adjust accordingly.

I also notice that some actions like "bridge_collapse" don't have a subject in the JSON, so in DPS, they will just be the action without a subject. Similarly for actions where the object is missing.

Now, considering character names from the JSON: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Enemy. I'll ensure these are correctly placed as subjects or objects in each line.

I should also make sure that the story name is 'STO' as per the example and the instructions. Then list all characters involved before detailing the actions they perform.

Wait, looking back at the example provided by the user, it starts with "Sto" followed by listing actors and then their interactions. So I need to include the characters as actors first before the actions.

So, I'll structure it as:

```
Sto
; Actors:
Jaguar_Knight Actor
Princess Actor
Enemy Actor

; Actions:
bridge_collapse Jaguar_Knight
Princess apply_curative_plasma Jaguar_Knight
...
```

This ensures that all involved characters are listed before the actions they perform.

I also need to ensure that each action line in DPS matches the JSON's subject and object, omitting any that aren't present. For example, "bridge_collapse" has no subject, so it will be just the action followed by the object.

Let me now assemble all these into the correct DPS format.
