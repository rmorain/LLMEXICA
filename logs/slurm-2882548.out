Story:  Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.

First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!

Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.

Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.

By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window.

By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder.

<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze this story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions that relate to emotional links (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions in the narrative. Since there are no romantic elements here, I'll focus on non-romantic emotional links and the specified tension types.

First, I'll go through each event in the story step by step. The Bears leave their porridge to cool, which shows they're considerate of each other's comfort—maybe a non-romantic emotional link like trust or camaraderie. Then Goldilocks enters, starts tasting the porridges. This action doesn't involve emotional links but does show her curiosity and rudeness.

When she eats up Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that could cause distress for him, so an emotional link of dislike or anger from the Bears towards Goldilocks. Next, she sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. This adds more tension because now there's damage, which might escalate the conflict.

Goldilocks then goes upstairs and sleeps in the Little Wee Bear's bed. When the Bears return and find their porridge tampered with, they express anger and suspicion, showing a clear non-romantic emotional link of distrust or hostility towards the intruder. They check each chair and bed, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.

The tension here is high because it involves an intruder in their home, which fits the 'prisoner' category since she's caught. When they confront her, she flees, adding a life-at-risk moment if she jumps out the window. The story ends without resolving her fate, so that's a lingering tension.

I need to map each action with the correct keys: n_characters, subject, object. Actions like 'taste_porridge' involve two characters (Goldilocks and each Bear), so n_characters is 2. Similarly, 'eat_porridge' would be Goldilocks as subject and Little Wee Bear as object.

I have to ensure that each action is in snake_case and abstract enough for reuse. Also, avoid including any actions involving objects, only those between characters. So, when the Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's an emotional link of distrust or anger towards Goldilocks.

Wait, some actions might not involve another character as object. For example, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's just her action without a direct object. But in this case, since she sits in the Bear's chairs, each 'sit_in-chair' action should have the respective Bear as object.

Also, I need to consider if an action involves only one character or two. For instance, when Goldilocks falls asleep, it's just her, so subject is herself and no object. But when Bears find their things messed with, they are the subjects, but who is the object? It might be about the state of their belongings, which are objects, so perhaps these don't qualify as emotional links between characters.

Wait, no—emotional links are between characters, so maybe those actions where a Bear reacts to Goldilocks's actions would count. Like when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tasted, that's an action with himself as subject and Goldilocks as object? Or is it about the Bears expressing emotions towards an unknown person (Goldilocks), which is still an emotional link.

I think each of these detection moments ("SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!") indicates an emotional reaction towards the intruder, so that's a non-romantic emotional link where the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So each of those would be actions like 'express_anger_towards' with subject as Bear and object as Goldilocks.

But in the JSON structure provided earlier, it's more about direct interactions. Maybe I should represent these as 'discover_vandalism' without an object since it's about their things, not another character. But according to the user's instruction, actions should involve subject and object as characters. So perhaps I need to model these as Bears noticing Goldilocks's presence, hence 'detect_intruder'.

Wait, but when they first find the spoons in the porridge, that's an action of detecting something done by someone else. Since it's about their property, maybe it doesn't involve another character directly. So perhaps I should skip those and focus only on actions where both subject and object are characters.

So, for each Bear checking their porridge, since they're not interacting with Goldilocks directly yet, maybe that's more of a setup for tension rather than emotional links. The emotional link would come when they confront her or react to her presence.

When the Bears go upstairs and find Goldilocks in the bed, that's a direct interaction: Little Wee Bear discovers her. So that action would be 'find_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear and object as Goldilocks.

Then, when she wakes up and sees them, that's another emotional link of fear or surprise from Goldilocks towards the Bears. So an action like 'see_intruder' with Goldilocks as subject and the Bears as objects? Or since each Bear is a character, perhaps list all three as separate objects, but according to the structure, I can only have one object per action.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as 'see_characters', with n_characters=4 (Goldilocks and the three Bears), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each Bear is a distinct character, perhaps multiple actions: Great Big Bear sees Goldilocks, Middle-sized Bear sees her, etc. But that would be repetitive.

Alternatively, maybe just one action where the group of Bears discover Goldilocks, so n_characters=4 (three Bears and Goldilocks). So 'discover_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear (since he's the one who actually finds her) and object as Goldilocks. Then Goldilocks sees them, which would be another action: 'see_characters' with subject as Goldilocks and object as the three Bears.

Then she escapes, which is an action without a direct object—just herself fleeing, so n_characters=1. Finally, the Bears don't see her again, so that's an action of ceasing to see her.

In terms of tensions, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, that's property damage but not directly a tension type listed (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). So maybe that doesn't count. When she is caught in bed, that could be considered 'prisoner' since she's intruding and now faces consequences—so that's a tension of type 'prisoner'. Her escape could involve 'life_at_risk' if jumping from the window is dangerous.

So, compiling all these actions with their respective subjects and objects, ensuring n_characters matches. Also, making sure each action is abstract enough for other stories, like 'taste_food', 'eat_food_all', etc., without mentioning specific characters in the action name.

Here's a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:

### Explanation:
- **Emotional Links**: The actions "express_anger_towards" and "see_characters" highlight non-romantic emotional links, primarily distrust and anger towards Goldilocks.
- **Tensions**: The action "discover_in_bed" introduces the tension type 'prisoner' as Goldilocks is caught intruding. Her subsequent escape might imply a 'life_at_risk' tension if her jump is perilous.

This structured approach captures the essential interactions and tensions, maintaining simplicity and abstraction for potential reuse in other narratives.

time=2025-04-15T15:20:53.023-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions that relate to emotional links (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions in the narrative. Since there are no romantic elements here, I'll focus on non-romantic emotional links and the specified tension types.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event in the story step by step. The Bears leave their porridge to cool, which shows they're considerate of each other's comfort—maybe a non-romantic emotional link like trust or camaraderie. Then Goldilocks enters, starts tasting the porridges. This action doesn't involve emotional links but does show her curiosity and rudeness.\n\nWhen she eats up Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that could cause distress for him, so an emotional link of dislike or anger from the Bears towards Goldilocks. Next, she sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. This adds more tension because now there's damage, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nGoldilocks then goes upstairs and sleeps in the Little Wee Bear's bed. When the Bears return and find their porridge tampered with, they express anger and suspicion, showing a clear non-romantic emotional link of distrust or hostility towards the intruder. They check each chair and bed, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nThe tension here is high because it involves an intruder in their home, which fits the 'prisoner' category since she's caught. When they confront her, she flees, adding a life-at-risk moment if she jumps out the window. The story ends without resolving her fate, so that's a lingering tension.\n\nI need to map each action with the correct keys: n_characters, subject, object. Actions like 'taste_porridge' involve two characters (Goldilocks and each Bear), so n_characters is 2. Similarly, 'eat_porridge' would be Goldilocks as subject and Little Wee Bear as object.\n\nI have to ensure that each action is in snake_case and abstract enough for reuse. Also, avoid including any actions involving objects, only those between characters. So, when the Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's an emotional link of distrust or anger towards Goldilocks.\n\nWait, some actions might not involve another character as object. For example, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's just her action without a direct object. But in this case, since she sits in the Bear's chairs, each 'sit_in-chair' action should have the respective Bear as object.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if an action involves only one character or two. For instance, when Goldilocks falls asleep, it's just her, so subject is herself and no object. But when Bears find their things messed with, they are the subjects, but who is the object? It might be about the state of their belongings, which are objects, so perhaps these don't qualify as emotional links between characters.\n\nWait, no—emotional links are between characters, so maybe those actions where a Bear reacts to Goldilocks's actions would count. Like when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tasted, that's an action with himself as subject and Goldilocks as object? Or is it about the Bears expressing emotions towards an unknown person (Goldilocks), which is still an emotional link.\n\nI think each of these detection moments (\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\") indicates an emotional reaction towards the intruder, so that's a non-romantic emotional link where the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So each of those would be actions like 'express_anger_towards' with subject as Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nBut in the JSON structure provided earlier, it's more about direct interactions. Maybe I should represent these as 'discover_vandalism' without an object since it's about their things, not another character. But according to the user's instruction, actions should involve subject and object as characters. So perhaps I need to model these as Bears noticing Goldilocks's presence, hence 'detect_intruder'.\n\nWait, but when they first find the spoons in the porridge, that's an action of detecting something done by someone else. Since it's about their property, maybe it doesn't involve another character directly. So perhaps I should skip those and focus only on actions where both subject and object are characters.\n\nSo, for each Bear checking their porridge, since they're not interacting with Goldilocks directly yet, maybe that's more of a setup for tension rather than emotional links. The emotional link would come when they confront her or react to her presence.\n\nWhen the Bears go upstairs and find Goldilocks in the bed, that's a direct interaction: Little Wee Bear discovers her. So that action would be 'find_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nThen, when she wakes up and sees them, that's another emotional link of fear or surprise from Goldilocks towards the Bears. So an action like 'see_intruder' with Goldilocks as subject and the Bears as objects? Or since each Bear is a character, perhaps list all three as separate objects, but according to the structure, I can only have one object per action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as 'see_characters', with n_characters=4 (Goldilocks and the three Bears), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each Bear is a distinct character, perhaps multiple actions: Great Big Bear sees Goldilocks, Middle-sized Bear sees her, etc. But that would be repetitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one action where the group of Bears discover Goldilocks, so n_characters=4 (three Bears and Goldilocks). So 'discover_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear (since he's the one who actually finds her) and object as Goldilocks. Then Goldilocks sees them, which would be another action: 'see_characters' with subject as Goldilocks and object as the three Bears.\n\nThen she escapes, which is an action without a direct object—just herself fleeing, so n_characters=1. Finally, the Bears don't see her again, so that's an action of ceasing to see her.\n\nIn terms of tensions, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, that's property damage but not directly a tension type listed (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). So maybe that doesn't count. When she is caught in bed, that could be considered 'prisoner' since she's intruding and now faces consequences—so that's a tension of type 'prisoner'. Her escape could involve 'life_at_risk' if jumping from the window is dangerous.\n\nSo, compiling all these actions with their respective subjects and objects, ensuring n_characters matches. Also, making sure each action is abstract enough for other stories, like 'taste_food', 'eat_food_all', etc., without mentioning specific characters in the action name.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enter_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_food_all\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in-bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"discover_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"see_characters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Three Bears\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"not_see_again\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Emotional Links**: The actions \"express_anger_towards\" and \"see_characters\" highlight non-romantic emotional links, primarily distrust and anger towards Goldilocks.\n- **Tensions**: The action \"discover_in_bed\" introduces the tension type 'prisoner' as Goldilocks is caught intruding. Her subsequent escape might imply a 'life_at_risk' tension if her jump is perilous.\n\nThis structured approach captures the essential interactions and tensions, maintaining simplicity and abstraction for potential reuse in other narratives.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph.

<think>
Alright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this case, it's definitely non-romantic since there are no romantic elements between Goldilocks and the Bears.

First, let me recall what a precondition is in this context: it’s an emotional link that must exist for a character to perform a specific action. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or affection.

Starting with the first action: "leave_to_cool". This involves all three Bears leaving their porridge to cool. Since this is a collaborative action, it suggests that they trust each other. So, there might be a non-romantic emotional link of trust among them. The magnitude could be positive, say 2, because it's a moderate level of trust, not extremely high or low.

Next, Goldilocks "enter_house". This action doesn’t directly involve another character, so no emotional links are required here. She’s just being curious or nosy, which doesn’t depend on any prior emotions towards the Bears.

Then, she "taste_food" from Great Big Bear's bowl. For her to take this action, she must be curious about their porridge. This curiosity isn’t necessarily an emotional link; it's more about her personality trait. So, no preconditions here either.

Moving on, she continues to taste Middle-sized Bear's and Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Each time, the same logic applies—curiosity drives these actions, not any specific emotional links towards the Bears. Therefore, no preconditions are needed for these actions.

When Goldilocks "eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear's bowl, she must have a dislike or indifference towards him to consume all his porridge. This could be an emotional link of non-romantic type with a magnitude of -1 (mild dislike).

Next, she sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. There’s no emotional aspect here; it's just about comfort, so no preconditions.

Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about her preference for softness, not emotions towards him. Again, no preconditions needed.

However, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could stem from frustration or carelessness, indicating a negative emotional link. So, maybe non-romantic with magnitude -2 (some frustration).

Goldilocks then sleeps in the bed of Great Big Bear and finds it too high. This is about comfort, not emotions.

She tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and it’s also uncomfortable for her. Again, no emotional preconditions here.

Finally, she rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's just right. There might be a mild positive emotional link here since she feels comfortable, so non-romantic with magnitude 1 (comfort).

The Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. Great Big Bear notices his spoon in the porridge, Middle-sized Bear sees his, and Little Wee Bear finds his porridge all gone. Each of these actions requires that the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So, non-romantic emotional links with magnitude -2 (anger) from each Bear towards Goldilocks.

They check their chairs and find them disturbed, leading to similar emotions—non-romantic, magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.

Going upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. Great Big Bear’s bed is disarranged, Middle-sized Bear’s bolster is moved, and Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep. These discoveries again involve anger or violation, so non-romantic links with magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.

When Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks, it's a direct confrontation. He might feel shocked or scared, indicating another non-romantic link of fear, magnitude -3 (intense negative emotion) from him towards her.

Goldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This would be a non-romantic emotional link of fear with magnitude -3 from her towards them.

She escapes through the window, which is driven by fear—non-romantic, magnitude -3 from her towards the Bears.

Finally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, indicating perhaps relief or lingering anger. This could be a non-romantic link of mild distrust, magnitude -1 from each Bear towards her.

So, compiling all these preconditions ensures that each action is grounded in the necessary emotional states of the characters involved.

### Explanation:
- **Emotional Links**: Each action now includes `preconditions` with `emotional_links` where necessary. These links indicate the emotional state required for a character to perform an action.
- **Magnitudes**: Ranging from -3 (intense dislike) to 2 (trust), these values reflect the intensity of the emotional link.
- **Sources and Targets**: Each link specifies who is feeling the emotion (`from`) and towards whom (`to`).

This JSON object captures the necessary emotional preconditions for each action, providing a structured understanding of the characters' motivations.

time=2025-04-15T15:22:04.875-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions that relate to emotional links (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions in the narrative. Since there are no romantic elements here, I'll focus on non-romantic emotional links and the specified tension types.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event in the story step by step. The Bears leave their porridge to cool, which shows they're considerate of each other's comfort—maybe a non-romantic emotional link like trust or camaraderie. Then Goldilocks enters, starts tasting the porridges. This action doesn't involve emotional links but does show her curiosity and rudeness.\n\nWhen she eats up Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that could cause distress for him, so an emotional link of dislike or anger from the Bears towards Goldilocks. Next, she sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. This adds more tension because now there's damage, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nGoldilocks then goes upstairs and sleeps in the Little Wee Bear's bed. When the Bears return and find their porridge tampered with, they express anger and suspicion, showing a clear non-romantic emotional link of distrust or hostility towards the intruder. They check each chair and bed, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nThe tension here is high because it involves an intruder in their home, which fits the 'prisoner' category since she's caught. When they confront her, she flees, adding a life-at-risk moment if she jumps out the window. The story ends without resolving her fate, so that's a lingering tension.\n\nI need to map each action with the correct keys: n_characters, subject, object. Actions like 'taste_porridge' involve two characters (Goldilocks and each Bear), so n_characters is 2. Similarly, 'eat_porridge' would be Goldilocks as subject and Little Wee Bear as object.\n\nI have to ensure that each action is in snake_case and abstract enough for reuse. Also, avoid including any actions involving objects, only those between characters. So, when the Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's an emotional link of distrust or anger towards Goldilocks.\n\nWait, some actions might not involve another character as object. For example, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's just her action without a direct object. But in this case, since she sits in the Bear's chairs, each 'sit_in-chair' action should have the respective Bear as object.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if an action involves only one character or two. For instance, when Goldilocks falls asleep, it's just her, so subject is herself and no object. But when Bears find their things messed with, they are the subjects, but who is the object? It might be about the state of their belongings, which are objects, so perhaps these don't qualify as emotional links between characters.\n\nWait, no—emotional links are between characters, so maybe those actions where a Bear reacts to Goldilocks's actions would count. Like when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tasted, that's an action with himself as subject and Goldilocks as object? Or is it about the Bears expressing emotions towards an unknown person (Goldilocks), which is still an emotional link.\n\nI think each of these detection moments (\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\") indicates an emotional reaction towards the intruder, so that's a non-romantic emotional link where the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So each of those would be actions like 'express_anger_towards' with subject as Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nBut in the JSON structure provided earlier, it's more about direct interactions. Maybe I should represent these as 'discover_vandalism' without an object since it's about their things, not another character. But according to the user's instruction, actions should involve subject and object as characters. So perhaps I need to model these as Bears noticing Goldilocks's presence, hence 'detect_intruder'.\n\nWait, but when they first find the spoons in the porridge, that's an action of detecting something done by someone else. Since it's about their property, maybe it doesn't involve another character directly. So perhaps I should skip those and focus only on actions where both subject and object are characters.\n\nSo, for each Bear checking their porridge, since they're not interacting with Goldilocks directly yet, maybe that's more of a setup for tension rather than emotional links. The emotional link would come when they confront her or react to her presence.\n\nWhen the Bears go upstairs and find Goldilocks in the bed, that's a direct interaction: Little Wee Bear discovers her. So that action would be 'find_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nThen, when she wakes up and sees them, that's another emotional link of fear or surprise from Goldilocks towards the Bears. So an action like 'see_intruder' with Goldilocks as subject and the Bears as objects? Or since each Bear is a character, perhaps list all three as separate objects, but according to the structure, I can only have one object per action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as 'see_characters', with n_characters=4 (Goldilocks and the three Bears), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each Bear is a distinct character, perhaps multiple actions: Great Big Bear sees Goldilocks, Middle-sized Bear sees her, etc. But that would be repetitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one action where the group of Bears discover Goldilocks, so n_characters=4 (three Bears and Goldilocks). So 'discover_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear (since he's the one who actually finds her) and object as Goldilocks. Then Goldilocks sees them, which would be another action: 'see_characters' with subject as Goldilocks and object as the three Bears.\n\nThen she escapes, which is an action without a direct object—just herself fleeing, so n_characters=1. Finally, the Bears don't see her again, so that's an action of ceasing to see her.\n\nIn terms of tensions, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, that's property damage but not directly a tension type listed (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). So maybe that doesn't count. When she is caught in bed, that could be considered 'prisoner' since she's intruding and now faces consequences—so that's a tension of type 'prisoner'. Her escape could involve 'life_at_risk' if jumping from the window is dangerous.\n\nSo, compiling all these actions with their respective subjects and objects, ensuring n_characters matches. Also, making sure each action is abstract enough for other stories, like 'taste_food', 'eat_food_all', etc., without mentioning specific characters in the action name.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enter_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_food_all\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in-bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"discover_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"see_characters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Three Bears\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"not_see_again\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Emotional Links**: The actions \"express_anger_towards\" and \"see_characters\" highlight non-romantic emotional links, primarily distrust and anger towards Goldilocks.\n- **Tensions**: The action \"discover_in_bed\" introduces the tension type 'prisoner' as Goldilocks is caught intruding. Her subsequent escape might imply a 'life_at_risk' tension if her jump is perilous.\n\nThis structured approach captures the essential interactions and tensions, maintaining simplicity and abstraction for potential reuse in other narratives.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this case, it's definitely non-romantic since there are no romantic elements between Goldilocks and the Bears.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a precondition is in this context: it’s an emotional link that must exist for a character to perform a specific action. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or affection.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"leave_to_cool\". This involves all three Bears leaving their porridge to cool. Since this is a collaborative action, it suggests that they trust each other. So, there might be a non-romantic emotional link of trust among them. The magnitude could be positive, say 2, because it's a moderate level of trust, not extremely high or low.\n\nNext, Goldilocks \"enter_house\". This action doesn’t directly involve another character, so no emotional links are required here. She’s just being curious or nosy, which doesn’t depend on any prior emotions towards the Bears.\n\nThen, she \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear's bowl. For her to take this action, she must be curious about their porridge. This curiosity isn’t necessarily an emotional link; it's more about her personality trait. So, no preconditions here either.\n\nMoving on, she continues to taste Middle-sized Bear's and Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Each time, the same logic applies—curiosity drives these actions, not any specific emotional links towards the Bears. Therefore, no preconditions are needed for these actions.\n\nWhen Goldilocks \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear's bowl, she must have a dislike or indifference towards him to consume all his porridge. This could be an emotional link of non-romantic type with a magnitude of -1 (mild dislike).\n\nNext, she sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. There’s no emotional aspect here; it's just about comfort, so no preconditions.\n\nSimilarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about her preference for softness, not emotions towards him. Again, no preconditions needed.\n\nHowever, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could stem from frustration or carelessness, indicating a negative emotional link. So, maybe non-romantic with magnitude -2 (some frustration).\n\nGoldilocks then sleeps in the bed of Great Big Bear and finds it too high. This is about comfort, not emotions.\n\nShe tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and it’s also uncomfortable for her. Again, no emotional preconditions here.\n\nFinally, she rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's just right. There might be a mild positive emotional link here since she feels comfortable, so non-romantic with magnitude 1 (comfort).\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. Great Big Bear notices his spoon in the porridge, Middle-sized Bear sees his, and Little Wee Bear finds his porridge all gone. Each of these actions requires that the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So, non-romantic emotional links with magnitude -2 (anger) from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nThey check their chairs and find them disturbed, leading to similar emotions—non-romantic, magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nGoing upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. Great Big Bear’s bed is disarranged, Middle-sized Bear’s bolster is moved, and Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep. These discoveries again involve anger or violation, so non-romantic links with magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks, it's a direct confrontation. He might feel shocked or scared, indicating another non-romantic link of fear, magnitude -3 (intense negative emotion) from him towards her.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This would be a non-romantic emotional link of fear with magnitude -3 from her towards them.\n\nShe escapes through the window, which is driven by fear—non-romantic, magnitude -3 from her towards the Bears.\n\nFinally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, indicating perhaps relief or lingering anger. This could be a non-romantic link of mild distrust, magnitude -1 from each Bear towards her.\n\nSo, compiling all these preconditions ensures that each action is grounded in the necessary emotional states of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere's the JSON object with preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n

<think>
Alright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like 'character_dead', 'life_at_risk', 'health_at_risk', or 'prisoner'. These tensions must exist for an action to make sense.

Starting with the first action: "leave_to_cool". This is just the Bears leaving their porridge, so no tension is required here. The array remains empty.

Next, Goldilocks "enter_house". For her to enter, there might be a risk of her life if she’s trespassing, but since nothing happens immediately, maybe no tension is needed. Alternatively, entering someone else's house could imply a potential risk, so perhaps 'life_at_risk' with herself as the source and target.

She then "taste_food" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. Tasting porridge doesn’t inherently involve tension unless it's too hot or cold, which isn't the case here. So no tension is needed.

When she "eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, eating all his porridge might cause him distress later, but at this point, there's no immediate tension. So again, no preconditions related to tension are necessary.

Goldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. This action doesn’t introduce any tension; it’s just about comfort. Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about preference for softness, so no tension here either.

However, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could lead to a 'health_at_risk' situation if the broken chair causes injury. So, a tension of type 'health_at_risk' from Goldilocks to herself or others.

She then sleeps in Great Big Bear’s bed and finds it too high. Sleeping doesn’t inherently cause tension unless it leads to something risky, but in this case, it's just discomfort. So no tension is required here.

Trying Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finding it too low might not involve tension either; it’s about comfort again. But when she finally rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's comfortable, there’s no immediate tension unless her presence later causes a problem. For now, no tension is needed.

The Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. This action doesn’t directly involve tension unless the anger leads to conflict. Since they’re upset but haven’t confronted Goldilocks yet, maybe no tension is required here.

They check their chairs and find them disturbed, which makes them suspicious. Suspicion could imply that someone unauthorized has been there, leading to a potential 'prisoner' tension if they think an intruder is still present. So, perhaps a 'prisoner' type tension from the Bears towards Goldilocks.

Going upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. This discovery heightens the tension as they realize someone is or has been in their house. This could be another 'prisoner' type tension since Goldilocks is an intruder.

When Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks asleep, this confrontation introduces a direct threat. Goldilocks’s presence becomes a 'life_at_risk' tension for herself as she might face danger from the Bears or vice versa.

Goldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This fear escalates the tension to 'life_at_risk' as both parties are now aware of each other and a confrontation is imminent.

She escapes through the window, which definitely involves 'life_at_risk' since jumping from a window can be dangerous. The tension here is clear and present.

Finally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, but there might still be lingering tensions like 'prisoner' if they believe she’s still around or if they’re wary of future intrusions.

So, compiling these thoughts, I need to add a `tensions` array under `preconditions` for each action where applicable, specifying the type and the source and target characters.

### Explanation:
- **Tensions**: Each action now includes a `tensions` array under `preconditions`. These tensions indicate the type of risk or threat present, with sources and targets specified.
- **Types**: Tensions include 'life_at_risk' when there's potential danger and 'prisoner' when an intruder is detected. 'health_at_risk' is noted if physical harm is possible.
- **Sources and Targets**: These are defined to show which character is causing or experiencing the tension, using 'a' for the subject and 'b' for the object, with '*' indicating any character.

This structured JSON object now captures both emotional links and tensions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative’s dynamics.

time=2025-04-15T15:23:22.037-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions that relate to emotional links (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions in the narrative. Since there are no romantic elements here, I'll focus on non-romantic emotional links and the specified tension types.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event in the story step by step. The Bears leave their porridge to cool, which shows they're considerate of each other's comfort—maybe a non-romantic emotional link like trust or camaraderie. Then Goldilocks enters, starts tasting the porridges. This action doesn't involve emotional links but does show her curiosity and rudeness.\n\nWhen she eats up Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that could cause distress for him, so an emotional link of dislike or anger from the Bears towards Goldilocks. Next, she sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. This adds more tension because now there's damage, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nGoldilocks then goes upstairs and sleeps in the Little Wee Bear's bed. When the Bears return and find their porridge tampered with, they express anger and suspicion, showing a clear non-romantic emotional link of distrust or hostility towards the intruder. They check each chair and bed, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nThe tension here is high because it involves an intruder in their home, which fits the 'prisoner' category since she's caught. When they confront her, she flees, adding a life-at-risk moment if she jumps out the window. The story ends without resolving her fate, so that's a lingering tension.\n\nI need to map each action with the correct keys: n_characters, subject, object. Actions like 'taste_porridge' involve two characters (Goldilocks and each Bear), so n_characters is 2. Similarly, 'eat_porridge' would be Goldilocks as subject and Little Wee Bear as object.\n\nI have to ensure that each action is in snake_case and abstract enough for reuse. Also, avoid including any actions involving objects, only those between characters. So, when the Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's an emotional link of distrust or anger towards Goldilocks.\n\nWait, some actions might not involve another character as object. For example, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's just her action without a direct object. But in this case, since she sits in the Bear's chairs, each 'sit_in-chair' action should have the respective Bear as object.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if an action involves only one character or two. For instance, when Goldilocks falls asleep, it's just her, so subject is herself and no object. But when Bears find their things messed with, they are the subjects, but who is the object? It might be about the state of their belongings, which are objects, so perhaps these don't qualify as emotional links between characters.\n\nWait, no—emotional links are between characters, so maybe those actions where a Bear reacts to Goldilocks's actions would count. Like when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tasted, that's an action with himself as subject and Goldilocks as object? Or is it about the Bears expressing emotions towards an unknown person (Goldilocks), which is still an emotional link.\n\nI think each of these detection moments (\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\") indicates an emotional reaction towards the intruder, so that's a non-romantic emotional link where the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So each of those would be actions like 'express_anger_towards' with subject as Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nBut in the JSON structure provided earlier, it's more about direct interactions. Maybe I should represent these as 'discover_vandalism' without an object since it's about their things, not another character. But according to the user's instruction, actions should involve subject and object as characters. So perhaps I need to model these as Bears noticing Goldilocks's presence, hence 'detect_intruder'.\n\nWait, but when they first find the spoons in the porridge, that's an action of detecting something done by someone else. Since it's about their property, maybe it doesn't involve another character directly. So perhaps I should skip those and focus only on actions where both subject and object are characters.\n\nSo, for each Bear checking their porridge, since they're not interacting with Goldilocks directly yet, maybe that's more of a setup for tension rather than emotional links. The emotional link would come when they confront her or react to her presence.\n\nWhen the Bears go upstairs and find Goldilocks in the bed, that's a direct interaction: Little Wee Bear discovers her. So that action would be 'find_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nThen, when she wakes up and sees them, that's another emotional link of fear or surprise from Goldilocks towards the Bears. So an action like 'see_intruder' with Goldilocks as subject and the Bears as objects? Or since each Bear is a character, perhaps list all three as separate objects, but according to the structure, I can only have one object per action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as 'see_characters', with n_characters=4 (Goldilocks and the three Bears), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each Bear is a distinct character, perhaps multiple actions: Great Big Bear sees Goldilocks, Middle-sized Bear sees her, etc. But that would be repetitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one action where the group of Bears discover Goldilocks, so n_characters=4 (three Bears and Goldilocks). So 'discover_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear (since he's the one who actually finds her) and object as Goldilocks. Then Goldilocks sees them, which would be another action: 'see_characters' with subject as Goldilocks and object as the three Bears.\n\nThen she escapes, which is an action without a direct object—just herself fleeing, so n_characters=1. Finally, the Bears don't see her again, so that's an action of ceasing to see her.\n\nIn terms of tensions, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, that's property damage but not directly a tension type listed (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). So maybe that doesn't count. When she is caught in bed, that could be considered 'prisoner' since she's intruding and now faces consequences—so that's a tension of type 'prisoner'. Her escape could involve 'life_at_risk' if jumping from the window is dangerous.\n\nSo, compiling all these actions with their respective subjects and objects, ensuring n_characters matches. Also, making sure each action is abstract enough for other stories, like 'taste_food', 'eat_food_all', etc., without mentioning specific characters in the action name.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enter_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_food_all\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in-bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"discover_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"see_characters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Three Bears\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"not_see_again\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Emotional Links**: The actions \"express_anger_towards\" and \"see_characters\" highlight non-romantic emotional links, primarily distrust and anger towards Goldilocks.\n- **Tensions**: The action \"discover_in_bed\" introduces the tension type 'prisoner' as Goldilocks is caught intruding. Her subsequent escape might imply a 'life_at_risk' tension if her jump is perilous.\n\nThis structured approach captures the essential interactions and tensions, maintaining simplicity and abstraction for potential reuse in other narratives.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this case, it's definitely non-romantic since there are no romantic elements between Goldilocks and the Bears.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a precondition is in this context: it’s an emotional link that must exist for a character to perform a specific action. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or affection.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"leave_to_cool\". This involves all three Bears leaving their porridge to cool. Since this is a collaborative action, it suggests that they trust each other. So, there might be a non-romantic emotional link of trust among them. The magnitude could be positive, say 2, because it's a moderate level of trust, not extremely high or low.\n\nNext, Goldilocks \"enter_house\". This action doesn’t directly involve another character, so no emotional links are required here. She’s just being curious or nosy, which doesn’t depend on any prior emotions towards the Bears.\n\nThen, she \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear's bowl. For her to take this action, she must be curious about their porridge. This curiosity isn’t necessarily an emotional link; it's more about her personality trait. So, no preconditions here either.\n\nMoving on, she continues to taste Middle-sized Bear's and Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Each time, the same logic applies—curiosity drives these actions, not any specific emotional links towards the Bears. Therefore, no preconditions are needed for these actions.\n\nWhen Goldilocks \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear's bowl, she must have a dislike or indifference towards him to consume all his porridge. This could be an emotional link of non-romantic type with a magnitude of -1 (mild dislike).\n\nNext, she sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. There’s no emotional aspect here; it's just about comfort, so no preconditions.\n\nSimilarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about her preference for softness, not emotions towards him. Again, no preconditions needed.\n\nHowever, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could stem from frustration or carelessness, indicating a negative emotional link. So, maybe non-romantic with magnitude -2 (some frustration).\n\nGoldilocks then sleeps in the bed of Great Big Bear and finds it too high. This is about comfort, not emotions.\n\nShe tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and it’s also uncomfortable for her. Again, no emotional preconditions here.\n\nFinally, she rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's just right. There might be a mild positive emotional link here since she feels comfortable, so non-romantic with magnitude 1 (comfort).\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. Great Big Bear notices his spoon in the porridge, Middle-sized Bear sees his, and Little Wee Bear finds his porridge all gone. Each of these actions requires that the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So, non-romantic emotional links with magnitude -2 (anger) from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nThey check their chairs and find them disturbed, leading to similar emotions—non-romantic, magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nGoing upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. Great Big Bear’s bed is disarranged, Middle-sized Bear’s bolster is moved, and Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep. These discoveries again involve anger or violation, so non-romantic links with magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks, it's a direct confrontation. He might feel shocked or scared, indicating another non-romantic link of fear, magnitude -3 (intense negative emotion) from him towards her.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This would be a non-romantic emotional link of fear with magnitude -3 from her towards them.\n\nShe escapes through the window, which is driven by fear—non-romantic, magnitude -3 from her towards the Bears.\n\nFinally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, indicating perhaps relief or lingering anger. This could be a non-romantic link of mild distrust, magnitude -1 from each Bear towards her.\n\nSo, compiling all these preconditions ensures that each action is grounded in the necessary emotional states of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere's the JSON object with preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n

These links indicate the emotional state required for a character to perform an action.\n- **Magnitudes**: Ranging from -3 (intense dislike) to 2 (trust), these values reflect the intensity of the emotional link.\n- **Sources and Targets**: Each link specifies who is feeling the emotion (`from`) and towards whom (`to`).\n\nThis JSON object captures the necessary emotional preconditions for each action, providing a structured understanding of the characters' motivations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like 'character_dead', 'life_at_risk', 'health_at_risk', or 'prisoner'. These tensions must exist for an action to make sense.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"leave_to_cool\". This is just the Bears leaving their porridge, so no tension is required here. The array remains empty.\n\nNext, Goldilocks \"enter_house\". For her to enter, there might be a risk of her life if she’s trespassing, but since nothing happens immediately, maybe no tension is needed. Alternatively, entering someone else's house could imply a potential risk, so perhaps 'life_at_risk' with herself as the source and target.\n\nShe then \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. Tasting porridge doesn’t inherently involve tension unless it's too hot or cold, which isn't the case here. So no tension is needed.\n\nWhen she \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, eating all his porridge might cause him distress later, but at this point, there's no immediate tension. So again, no preconditions related to tension are necessary.\n\nGoldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. This action doesn’t introduce any tension; it’s just about comfort. Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about preference for softness, so no tension here either.\n\nHowever, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could lead to a 'health_at_risk' situation if the broken chair causes injury. So, a tension of type 'health_at_risk' from Goldilocks to herself or others.\n\nShe then sleeps in Great Big Bear’s bed and finds it too high. Sleeping doesn’t inherently cause tension unless it leads to something risky, but in this case, it's just discomfort. So no tension is required here.\n\nTrying Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finding it too low might not involve tension either; it’s about comfort again. But when she finally rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's comfortable, there’s no immediate tension unless her presence later causes a problem. For now, no tension is needed.\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. This action doesn’t directly involve tension unless the anger leads to conflict. Since they’re upset but haven’t confronted Goldilocks yet, maybe no tension is required here.\n\nThey check their chairs and find them disturbed, which makes them suspicious. Suspicion could imply that someone unauthorized has been there, leading to a potential 'prisoner' tension if they think an intruder is still present. So, perhaps a 'prisoner' type tension from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nGoing upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. This discovery heightens the tension as they realize someone is or has been in their house. This could be another 'prisoner' type tension since Goldilocks is an intruder.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks asleep, this confrontation introduces a direct threat. Goldilocks’s presence becomes a 'life_at_risk' tension for herself as she might face danger from the Bears or vice versa.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This fear escalates the tension to 'life_at_risk' as both parties are now aware of each other and a confrontation is imminent.\n\nShe escapes through the window, which definitely involves 'life_at_risk' since jumping from a window can be dangerous. The tension here is clear and present.\n\nFinally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, but there might still be lingering tensions like 'prisoner' if they believe she’s still around or if they’re wary of future intrusions.\n\nSo, compiling these thoughts, I need to add a `tensions` array under `preconditions` for each action where applicable, specifying the type and the source and target characters.\n</think>\n\nHere's the JSON object with preconditions related to tensions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n

'health_at_risk' is noted if physical harm is possible.\n- **Sources and Targets**: These are defined to show which character is causing or experiencing the tension, using 'a' for the subject and 'b' for the object, with '*' indicating any character.\n\nThis structured JSON object now captures both emotional links and tensions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative’s dynamics.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes resulting from an action, affecting either emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required per action, and if preconditions exist, they shouldn’t be the same as postconditions.

Starting with "leave_to_cool". This action likely creates a positive emotional link among the Bears due to their cooperative nature. So, a non-romantic link of trust with magnitude 1 from each Bear towards the others. There’s no tension here, so `tensions` remain empty.

Goldilocks "enter_house" introduces a potential threat. Her entrance might create a negative emotional link from the Bears towards her (non-romantic, dislike). Tension-wise, this could introduce 'life_at_risk' since she’s an intruder.

She "taste_food" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. This invasion of privacy likely creates a negative emotional link from him towards her. No immediate tension arises beyond what's already present.

When she "eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, he might feel strongly negative towards her, intensifying the emotional link to dislike or anger (magnitude -2). This action also resolves any previous 'health_at_risk' if eating all his food doesn’t cause harm, but since it’s just porridge, maybe no health risk.

Goldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it uncomfortable. This could create a mild negative emotional link towards her from him due to the intrusion. No new tensions arise here.

Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair might lead to a slight negative link from him towards Goldilocks. Again, no additional tension beyond the existing 'life_at_risk'.

Breaking Little Wee Bear’s chair escalates the situation. He might develop a stronger negative emotional link (magnitude -3) and could introduce a new tension like 'prisoner' since his property is damaged.

Sleeping in Great Big Bear’s bed comfortably creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him, but given the context, it’s more about her comfort than genuine affection. No tensions are introduced here.

She tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finds it too low, which might lead to a neutral or slightly negative link from him towards her. No new tensions arise.

Finally resting in Little Wee Bear’s bed creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him (magnitude 1), as she feels comfortable. This could resolve any previous 'discomfort' tension if it existed.

The Bears return home and express anger, discovering their porridge was tampered with. Their negative emotional links towards Goldilocks intensify (magnitude -2). The tension here is 'prisoner' as they realize an intruder has been in their house.

Checking their chairs and finding them disturbed further escalates the negative links from each Bear towards Goldilocks (magnitude -3). This also introduces or maintains a 'prisoner' tension.

Going upstairs, they find their beds have been slept in. Discovering this increases their anger, reinforcing the negative emotional links (magnitude -2). The tension here remains 'prisoner'.

When Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep, his shock intensifies the negative link towards her (magnitude -3). This confrontation heightens the 'life_at_risk' tension for both parties.

Goldilocks wakes up and sees the Bears, leading to fear. Her negative emotional link towards them becomes more intense (magnitude -3), and the 'life_at_risk' tension escalates as she realizes the danger.

She escapes through the window, likely resolving the immediate 'prisoner' tension but introducing a new 'life_at_risk' as jumping could be dangerous. The Bears no longer see her, which might reduce the 'prisoner' tension but leaves lingering negative emotional links.

Finally, not seeing Goldilocks again means the Bears might feel relief, reducing some negative emotions, but mild distrust remains (magnitude -1). Any remaining tensions like 'life_at_risk' are resolved as she’s gone.

I need to ensure each action updates both `emotional_links` and `tensions` in `postconditions`, reflecting changes from the action's outcome. Also, if an action affects emotional links or tensions, it should be clearly noted without repeating preconditions.

### Explanation:
- **Postconditions**: Each action now includes `postconditions` with updated `emotional_links` and `tensions`. These changes reflect the outcomes of each action on the characters' emotions and the narrative's tensions.
- **Emotional Links**: Positive or negative links are adjusted based on the action’s impact. For example, breaking a chair intensifies Little Wee Bear’s dislike towards Goldilocks.
- **Tensions**: Actions that resolve previous tensions (like freeing a prisoner) or introduce new ones (like increased risk) are noted. The JSON ensures that postconditions don’t mirror preconditions unless necessary.

This structured approach provides a clear progression of emotional and tensional dynamics throughout the narrative.

time=2025-04-15T15:25:12.918-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions that relate to emotional links (both non-romantic and romantic) and tensions in the narrative. Since there are no romantic elements here, I'll focus on non-romantic emotional links and the specified tension types.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event in the story step by step. The Bears leave their porridge to cool, which shows they're considerate of each other's comfort—maybe a non-romantic emotional link like trust or camaraderie. Then Goldilocks enters, starts tasting the porridges. This action doesn't involve emotional links but does show her curiosity and rudeness.\n\nWhen she eats up Little Wee Bear's porridge entirely, that could cause distress for him, so an emotional link of dislike or anger from the Bears towards Goldilocks. Next, she sits in their chairs, breaking the Little Wee Bear's chair. This adds more tension because now there's damage, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nGoldilocks then goes upstairs and sleeps in the Little Wee Bear's bed. When the Bears return and find their porridge tampered with, they express anger and suspicion, showing a clear non-romantic emotional link of distrust or hostility towards the intruder. They check each chair and bed, leading to the discovery of Goldilocks asleep.\n\nThe tension here is high because it involves an intruder in their home, which fits the 'prisoner' category since she's caught. When they confront her, she flees, adding a life-at-risk moment if she jumps out the window. The story ends without resolving her fate, so that's a lingering tension.\n\nI need to map each action with the correct keys: n_characters, subject, object. Actions like 'taste_porridge' involve two characters (Goldilocks and each Bear), so n_characters is 2. Similarly, 'eat_porridge' would be Goldilocks as subject and Little Wee Bear as object.\n\nI have to ensure that each action is in snake_case and abstract enough for reuse. Also, avoid including any actions involving objects, only those between characters. So, when the Bears find their porridge tampered with, it's an emotional link of distrust or anger towards Goldilocks.\n\nWait, some actions might not involve another character as object. For example, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, it's just her action without a direct object. But in this case, since she sits in the Bear's chairs, each 'sit_in-chair' action should have the respective Bear as object.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if an action involves only one character or two. For instance, when Goldilocks falls asleep, it's just her, so subject is herself and no object. But when Bears find their things messed with, they are the subjects, but who is the object? It might be about the state of their belongings, which are objects, so perhaps these don't qualify as emotional links between characters.\n\nWait, no—emotional links are between characters, so maybe those actions where a Bear reacts to Goldilocks's actions would count. Like when Great Big Bear notices his porridge was tasted, that's an action with himself as subject and Goldilocks as object? Or is it about the Bears expressing emotions towards an unknown person (Goldilocks), which is still an emotional link.\n\nI think each of these detection moments (\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\") indicates an emotional reaction towards the intruder, so that's a non-romantic emotional link where the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So each of those would be actions like 'express_anger_towards' with subject as Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nBut in the JSON structure provided earlier, it's more about direct interactions. Maybe I should represent these as 'discover_vandalism' without an object since it's about their things, not another character. But according to the user's instruction, actions should involve subject and object as characters. So perhaps I need to model these as Bears noticing Goldilocks's presence, hence 'detect_intruder'.\n\nWait, but when they first find the spoons in the porridge, that's an action of detecting something done by someone else. Since it's about their property, maybe it doesn't involve another character directly. So perhaps I should skip those and focus only on actions where both subject and object are characters.\n\nSo, for each Bear checking their porridge, since they're not interacting with Goldilocks directly yet, maybe that's more of a setup for tension rather than emotional links. The emotional link would come when they confront her or react to her presence.\n\nWhen the Bears go upstairs and find Goldilocks in the bed, that's a direct interaction: Little Wee Bear discovers her. So that action would be 'find_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear and object as Goldilocks.\n\nThen, when she wakes up and sees them, that's another emotional link of fear or surprise from Goldilocks towards the Bears. So an action like 'see_intruder' with Goldilocks as subject and the Bears as objects? Or since each Bear is a character, perhaps list all three as separate objects, but according to the structure, I can only have one object per action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as 'see_characters', with n_characters=4 (Goldilocks and the three Bears), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each Bear is a distinct character, perhaps multiple actions: Great Big Bear sees Goldilocks, Middle-sized Bear sees her, etc. But that would be repetitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one action where the group of Bears discover Goldilocks, so n_characters=4 (three Bears and Goldilocks). So 'discover_in_bed' with subject as Little Wee Bear (since he's the one who actually finds her) and object as Goldilocks. Then Goldilocks sees them, which would be another action: 'see_characters' with subject as Goldilocks and object as the three Bears.\n\nThen she escapes, which is an action without a direct object—just herself fleeing, so n_characters=1. Finally, the Bears don't see her again, so that's an action of ceasing to see her.\n\nIn terms of tensions, when Goldilocks breaks the chair, that's property damage but not directly a tension type listed (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner). So maybe that doesn't count. When she is caught in bed, that could be considered 'prisoner' since she's intruding and now faces consequences—so that's a tension of type 'prisoner'. Her escape could involve 'life_at_risk' if jumping from the window is dangerous.\n\nSo, compiling all these actions with their respective subjects and objects, ensuring n_characters matches. Also, making sure each action is abstract enough for other stories, like 'taste_food', 'eat_food_all', etc., without mentioning specific characters in the action name.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured JSON representation of the essential actions from the story, focusing on emotional links and tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enter_house\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"taste_food\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"eat_food_all\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Great Big Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sit_in-chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Middle-sized Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Little Wee Bear\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sleep_in-bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"return_home\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Great Big Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Middle-sized Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"express_anger_towards\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"discover_in_bed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Little Wee Bear\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wake_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"see_characters\",\n    \"n_characters\": 4,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"Three Bears\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"escape\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Goldilocks\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"not_see_again\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"Goldilocks\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Emotional Links**: The actions \"express_anger_towards\" and \"see_characters\" highlight non-romantic emotional links, primarily distrust and anger towards Goldilocks.\n- **Tensions**: The action \"discover_in_bed\" introduces the tension type 'prisoner' as Goldilocks is caught intruding. Her subsequent escape might imply a 'life_at_risk' tension if her jump is perilous.\n\nThis structured approach captures the essential interactions and tensions, maintaining simplicity and abstraction for potential reuse in other narratives.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the story and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, but in this case, it's definitely non-romantic since there are no romantic elements between Goldilocks and the Bears.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a precondition is in this context: it’s an emotional link that must exist for a character to perform a specific action. The magnitude ranges from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate dislike or hatred, and positive values indicate liking or affection.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"leave_to_cool\". This involves all three Bears leaving their porridge to cool. Since this is a collaborative action, it suggests that they trust each other. So, there might be a non-romantic emotional link of trust among them. The magnitude could be positive, say 2, because it's a moderate level of trust, not extremely high or low.\n\nNext, Goldilocks \"enter_house\". This action doesn’t directly involve another character, so no emotional links are required here. She’s just being curious or nosy, which doesn’t depend on any prior emotions towards the Bears.\n\nThen, she \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear's bowl. For her to take this action, she must be curious about their porridge. This curiosity isn’t necessarily an emotional link; it's more about her personality trait. So, no preconditions here either.\n\nMoving on, she continues to taste Middle-sized Bear's and Little Wee Bear’s porridge. Each time, the same logic applies—curiosity drives these actions, not any specific emotional links towards the Bears. Therefore, no preconditions are needed for these actions.\n\nWhen Goldilocks \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear's bowl, she must have a dislike or indifference towards him to consume all his porridge. This could be an emotional link of non-romantic type with a magnitude of -1 (mild dislike).\n\nNext, she sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. There’s no emotional aspect here; it's just about comfort, so no preconditions.\n\nSimilarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about her preference for softness, not emotions towards him. Again, no preconditions needed.\n\nHowever, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could stem from frustration or carelessness, indicating a negative emotional link. So, maybe non-romantic with magnitude -2 (some frustration).\n\nGoldilocks then sleeps in the bed of Great Big Bear and finds it too high. This is about comfort, not emotions.\n\nShe tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and it’s also uncomfortable for her. Again, no emotional preconditions here.\n\nFinally, she rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's just right. There might be a mild positive emotional link here since she feels comfortable, so non-romantic with magnitude 1 (comfort).\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. Great Big Bear notices his spoon in the porridge, Middle-sized Bear sees his, and Little Wee Bear finds his porridge all gone. Each of these actions requires that the Bears feel violated or angry towards Goldilocks. So, non-romantic emotional links with magnitude -2 (anger) from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nThey check their chairs and find them disturbed, leading to similar emotions—non-romantic, magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nGoing upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. Great Big Bear’s bed is disarranged, Middle-sized Bear’s bolster is moved, and Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep. These discoveries again involve anger or violation, so non-romantic links with magnitude -2 from each Bear towards Goldilocks.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks, it's a direct confrontation. He might feel shocked or scared, indicating another non-romantic link of fear, magnitude -3 (intense negative emotion) from him towards her.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This would be a non-romantic emotional link of fear with magnitude -3 from her towards them.\n\nShe escapes through the window, which is driven by fear—non-romantic, magnitude -3 from her towards the Bears.\n\nFinally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, indicating perhaps relief or lingering anger. This could be a non-romantic link of mild distrust, magnitude -1 from each Bear towards her.\n\nSo, compiling all these preconditions ensures that each action is grounded in the necessary emotional states of the characters involved.\n</think>\n\nHere's the JSON object with preconditions related to emotional links for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n

These links indicate the emotional state required for a character to perform an action.\n- **Magnitudes**: Ranging from -3 (intense dislike) to 2 (trust), these values reflect the intensity of the emotional link.\n- **Sources and Targets**: Each link specifies who is feeling the emotion (`from`) and towards whom (`to`).\n\nThis JSON object captures the necessary emotional preconditions for each action, providing a structured understanding of the characters' motivations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like 'character_dead', 'life_at_risk', 'health_at_risk', or 'prisoner'. These tensions must exist for an action to make sense.\n\nStarting with the first action: \"leave_to_cool\". This is just the Bears leaving their porridge, so no tension is required here. The array remains empty.\n\nNext, Goldilocks \"enter_house\". For her to enter, there might be a risk of her life if she’s trespassing, but since nothing happens immediately, maybe no tension is needed. Alternatively, entering someone else's house could imply a potential risk, so perhaps 'life_at_risk' with herself as the source and target.\n\nShe then \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. Tasting porridge doesn’t inherently involve tension unless it's too hot or cold, which isn't the case here. So no tension is needed.\n\nWhen she \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, eating all his porridge might cause him distress later, but at this point, there's no immediate tension. So again, no preconditions related to tension are necessary.\n\nGoldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it too hard. This action doesn’t introduce any tension; it’s just about comfort. Similarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair is about preference for softness, so no tension here either.\n\nHowever, when she breaks Little Wee Bear’s chair, this could lead to a 'health_at_risk' situation if the broken chair causes injury. So, a tension of type 'health_at_risk' from Goldilocks to herself or others.\n\nShe then sleeps in Great Big Bear’s bed and finds it too high. Sleeping doesn’t inherently cause tension unless it leads to something risky, but in this case, it's just discomfort. So no tension is required here.\n\nTrying Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finding it too low might not involve tension either; it’s about comfort again. But when she finally rests in Little Wee Bear’s bed because it's comfortable, there’s no immediate tension unless her presence later causes a problem. For now, no tension is needed.\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger about their porridge. This action doesn’t directly involve tension unless the anger leads to conflict. Since they’re upset but haven’t confronted Goldilocks yet, maybe no tension is required here.\n\nThey check their chairs and find them disturbed, which makes them suspicious. Suspicion could imply that someone unauthorized has been there, leading to a potential 'prisoner' tension if they think an intruder is still present. So, perhaps a 'prisoner' type tension from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\nGoing upstairs, they discover their beds have been slept in. This discovery heightens the tension as they realize someone is or has been in their house. This could be another 'prisoner' type tension since Goldilocks is an intruder.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finally sees Goldilocks asleep, this confrontation introduces a direct threat. Goldilocks’s presence becomes a 'life_at_risk' tension for herself as she might face danger from the Bears or vice versa.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up, sees the Bears, and gets scared. This fear escalates the tension to 'life_at_risk' as both parties are now aware of each other and a confrontation is imminent.\n\nShe escapes through the window, which definitely involves 'life_at_risk' since jumping from a window can be dangerous. The tension here is clear and present.\n\nFinally, the Bears don’t see Goldilocks again, but there might still be lingering tensions like 'prisoner' if they believe she’s still around or if they’re wary of future intrusions.\n\nSo, compiling these thoughts, I need to add a `tensions` array under `preconditions` for each action where applicable, specifying the type and the source and target characters.\n</think>\n\nHere's the JSON object with preconditions related to tensions for each action:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"leave_to_cool\",\n    \"n_characters\": 3,\n

These tensions indicate the type of risk or threat present, with sources and targets specified.\n- **Types**: Tensions include 'life_at_risk' when there's potential danger and 'prisoner' when an intruder is detected. 'health_at_risk' is noted if physical harm is possible.\n- **Sources and Targets**: These are defined to show which character is causing or experiencing the tension, using 'a' for the subject and 'b' for the object, with '*' indicating any character.\n\nThis structured JSON object now captures both emotional links and tensions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative’s dynamics.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the story and identify or infer postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes resulting from an action, affecting either emotional links or tensions. At least one postcondition is required per action, and if preconditions exist, they shouldn’t be the same as postconditions.\n\nStarting with \"leave_to_cool\". This action likely creates a positive emotional link among the Bears due to their cooperative nature. So, a non-romantic link of trust with magnitude 1 from each Bear towards the others. There’s no tension here, so `tensions` remain empty.\n\nGoldilocks \"enter_house\" introduces a potential threat. Her entrance might create a negative emotional link from the Bears towards her (non-romantic, dislike). Tension-wise, this could introduce 'life_at_risk' since she’s an intruder.\n\nShe \"taste_food\" from Great Big Bear’s bowl. This invasion of privacy likely creates a negative emotional link from him towards her. No immediate tension arises beyond what's already present.\n\nWhen she \"eat_food_all\" from Little Wee Bear’s bowl, he might feel strongly negative towards her, intensifying the emotional link to dislike or anger (magnitude -2). This action also resolves any previous 'health_at_risk' if eating all his food doesn’t cause harm, but since it’s just porridge, maybe no health risk.\n\nGoldilocks sits in Great Big Bear’s chair and finds it uncomfortable. This could create a mild negative emotional link towards her from him due to the intrusion. No new tensions arise here.\n\nSimilarly, sitting in Middle-sized Bear’s chair might lead to a slight negative link from him towards Goldilocks. Again, no additional tension beyond the existing 'life_at_risk'.\n\nBreaking Little Wee Bear’s chair escalates the situation. He might develop a stronger negative emotional link (magnitude -3) and could introduce a new tension like 'prisoner' since his property is damaged.\n\nSleeping in Great Big Bear’s bed comfortably creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him, but given the context, it’s more about her comfort than genuine affection. No tensions are introduced here.\n\nShe tries Middle-sized Bear’s bed and finds it too low, which might lead to a neutral or slightly negative link from him towards her. No new tensions arise.\n\nFinally resting in Little Wee Bear’s bed creates a positive emotional link from Goldilocks towards him (magnitude 1), as she feels comfortable. This could resolve any previous 'discomfort' tension if it existed.\n\nThe Bears return home and express anger, discovering their porridge was tampered with. Their negative emotional links towards Goldilocks intensify (magnitude -2). The tension here is 'prisoner' as they realize an intruder has been in their house.\n\nChecking their chairs and finding them disturbed further escalates the negative links from each Bear towards Goldilocks (magnitude -3). This also introduces or maintains a 'prisoner' tension.\n\nGoing upstairs, they find their beds have been slept in. Discovering this increases their anger, reinforcing the negative emotional links (magnitude -2). The tension here remains 'prisoner'.\n\nWhen Little Wee Bear finds Goldilocks asleep, his shock intensifies the negative link towards her (magnitude -3). This confrontation heightens the 'life_at_risk' tension for both parties.\n\nGoldilocks wakes up and sees the Bears, leading to fear. Her negative emotional link towards them becomes more intense (magnitude -3), and the 'life_at_risk' tension escalates as she realizes the danger.\n\nShe escapes through the window, likely resolving the immediate 'prisoner' tension but introducing a new 'life_at_risk' as jumping could be dangerous. The Bears no longer see her, which might reduce the 'prisoner' tension but leaves lingering negative emotional links.\n\nFinally, not seeing Goldilocks again means the Bears might feel relief, reducing some negative emotions, but mild distrust remains (magnitude -1). Any remaining tensions like 'life_at_risk' are resolved as she’s gone.\n\nI need to ensure each action updates both `emotional_links` and `tensions` in `postconditions`, reflecting changes from the action's outcome. Also, if an action affects emotional links or tensions, it should be clearly noted without repeating preconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with postconditions added for each

These changes reflect the outcomes of each action on the characters' emotions and the narrative's tensions.\n- **Emotional Links**: Positive or negative links are adjusted based on the action’s impact. For example, breaking a chair intensifies Little Wee Bear’s dislike towards Goldilocks.\n- **Tensions**: Actions that resolve previous tensions (like freeing a prisoner) or introduce new ones (like increased risk) are noted. The JSON ensures that postconditions don’t mirror preconditions unless necessary.\n\nThis structured approach provides a clear progression of emotional and tensional dynamics throughout the narrative.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Ensure logical consistency for each action. Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the JSON object adheres to all specified logical consistency rules. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, "leave_to_cool" has `n_characters`: 3 but both subject and object are "-", which is inconsistent. Since it's a group action without specific characters interacting, perhaps setting `subject` and `object` to "-" is acceptable, but I need to ensure `n_characters` reflects the number of characters involved in preconditions and postconditions.

Next, "enter_house" has Goldilocks as subject and no object. Preconditions include a tension with 'from' as "*" which isn't allowed; it should be 'a', 'b', or '-'. Also, postconditions introduce an emotional link from Bears to Goldilocks, but since the action only involves her, maybe this is incorrect.

"Taste_food" actions need to ensure that if there's an emotional link in postconditions, both subject and object are correctly set. For example, tasting Great Big Bear’s porridge should have him as 'b' in the link.

"Eat_food_all" from Little Wee Bear involves two characters, so `n_characters` is correct at 2. However, the preconditions include an emotional link from Goldilocks to him, but postconditions only update his link towards her, which seems inconsistent because she’s the one performing the action.

"Sitting_in-chair" actions need to ensure that if there's a negative emotional link created, it's correctly attributed from the chair owner (object) to Goldilocks (subject).

"Break_chair" has a precondition of health risk but postconditions resolve it without introducing a new tension. This seems off because breaking furniture might not necessarily resolve health risks.

Sleeping actions need to ensure that if an emotional link is created, both characters are correctly referenced. However, since sleeping doesn’t inherently create emotions towards the bed owner unless specified, these might be unnecessary.

Expressing anger actions must ensure that each Bear’s negative links towards Goldilocks are accurately captured without repeating preconditions as postconditions.

Discover_in-bed action should resolve any prisoner tension as Goldilocks is found, so postconditions should include 'prisoner_freed'.

Wake_up and see_characters need to correctly reference the characters involved, ensuring that tensions like life_at_risk are appropriately resolved or maintained.

Escape must reflect that Goldilocks frees herself, resolving her prisoner status and possibly introducing a life_normal tension if she’s no longer at risk.

Finally, not_see_again should ensure any lingering emotions are accurately noted without introducing new links.

I need to correct these inconsistencies by adjusting preconditions, postconditions, ensuring 'a' is the subject and 'b' the object in all links and tensions, and that each action has at least one meaningful postcondition.

### Explanation:
- **Logical Consistency**: Each action's `n_characters` now correctly reflects the number of characters involved, and 'a'/'b' are appropriately assigned to subject/object.
- **Emotional Links**: Postconditions only include emotional links that result from the action without mirroring preconditions unless necessary for progression.
- **Tensions**: Tensions are resolved or maintained logically, ensuring no character continues to experience tensions after they’ve been addressed.
- **Syntax and Formatting**: All JSON keys are correctly formatted, with valid values and proper structure.

This verified JSON object ensures that each action is logically consistent, with appropriate preconditions and postconditions reflecting the narrative's progression accurately.
