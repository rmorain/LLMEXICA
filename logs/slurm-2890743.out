Story:  n old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.

Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, "What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity." She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. "Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?" said she; "I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well."

"Be quiet, and do not weep," answered the frog, "I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?" "Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog," said she—"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing."

The frog answered, "I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again."

"Oh yes," said she, "I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again." She, however, thought, "How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!"

But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. "Wait, wait," said the frog. "Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst." But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.

The next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me." She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?" "Ah, no," replied she. "It is no giant but a disgusting frog."

"What does a frog want with thee?" "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."

In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,

"Princess! youngest princess!
Open the door for me!
Dost thou not know what thou saidst to me

Yesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?
Princess, youngest princess!
Open the door for me!"

Then said the King, "That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in." She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, "Lift me up beside thee." She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together." She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."

The King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, "He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee." So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father." Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. "Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog," said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."

"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well." Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:

Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."

"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well." Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry.

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.

First, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.

When the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.

The king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.

Throughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.

I need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.

time=2025-04-16T10:14:22.232-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.\n\nFirst, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.\n\nWhen the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.\n\nThe king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.\n\nThroughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.\n\nI need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cries\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"retrieves_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"refuses_entry\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"commands_obedience\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"king\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_castle\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_lift\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lifts_to_table\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_food\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"shares_meal\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_sleep\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`.

<think>
Alright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.

Starting with "loses_ball": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.

Next, "cries": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.

Moving to "promises_companionship": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.

Then, "retrieves_ball": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).

"runs_away": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.

"knocks_on_door": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).

"refuses_entry": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.

"commands_obedience": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).

"opens_door": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).

"enters_castle": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).

"requests_lift": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.

"lifts_to_table": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).

"requests_food": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).

"shares_meal": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.

"requests_sleep": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.

"throws_against_wall": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).

transforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.

time=2025-04-16T10:15:19.906-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.\n\nFirst, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.\n\nWhen the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.\n\nThe king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.\n\nThroughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.\n\nI need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cries\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"retrieves_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"refuses_entry\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"commands_obedience\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"king\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_castle\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_lift\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lifts_to_table\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_food\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"shares_meal\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_sleep\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.\n\nNext, \"cries\": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.\n\nMoving to \"promises_companionship\": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.\n\nThen, \"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"runs_away\": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"refuses_entry\": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).\n\n\"opens_door\": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).\n\n\"requests_lift\": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"requests_food\": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).\n\n\"shares_meal\": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).\n\ntransforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n

Alright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. 

Starting with "loses_ball": This event sets off the chain of actions, but by itself doesn't involve tension directly. So no tension here.

"cries": The princess is upset because she lost her ball, indicating emotional distress, which could imply that her mental health is at risk due to sadness. So maybe `health_at_risk` for the princess.

"promises_companionship": She makes a promise under duress of losing her favorite toy, suggesting some level of stress or coercion. This might relate to `prisoner` if she feels trapped by her promise.

"retrieves_ball": The frog retrieves the ball from the deep well, which could be risky for him. So perhaps `life_at_risk` for the frog as he's retrieving it from a dangerous place.

"runs_away": She runs away quickly, possibly indicating fear or urgency, so maybe her life is at risk if she doesn't escape, though this might be more emotional than physical.

"knocks_on_door": The frog insists on entering, which creates tension in the princess. This could be seen as a form of pressure or threat, maybe `life_at_risk` for the princess if she refuses.

"refuses_entry": She refuses entry, creating conflict and possibly putting her in a situation where she might face consequences, indicating `life_at_risk`.

"commands_obedience": The king's command adds authority to letting the frog in, which could increase tension for the princess, maybe `prisoner` as she feels forced.

"opens_door": Reluctantly opening the door introduces tension as the frog enters her private space. This might imply `health_at_risk` due to stress or anxiety.

"enters_castle": The frog entering creates ongoing tension in the castle environment, potentially indicating that characters feel their health is at risk due to discomfort.

"requests_lift": Requesting to be lifted up close could make the princess uncomfortable, suggesting her health might be at risk due to stress.

"lifts_to_table": Lifting the frog onto the table adds physical proximity, which might increase the princess's tension, indicating `health_at_risk`.

"requests_food": Sharing food together creates social tension and discomfort for the princess, possibly affecting her health.

"shares_meal": Eating together reluctantly could imply ongoing stress or anxiety for the princess, indicating `health_at_risk`.

"requests_sleep": Asking to sleep in her bed is a significant invasion of privacy, which might make the princess feel unsafe, indicating `life_at_risk` or `prisoner`.

"throws_against_wall": Throwing the frog indicates extreme frustration and urgency, suggesting that both characters are at risk of harm.

"transforms_into_prince": The transformation releases tension as the spell is broken, so no specific tension here.

time=2025-04-16T10:16:16.852-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.\n\nFirst, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.\n\nWhen the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.\n\nThe king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.\n\nThroughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.\n\nI need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cries\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"retrieves_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"refuses_entry\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"commands_obedience\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"king\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_castle\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_lift\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lifts_to_table\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_food\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"shares_meal\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_sleep\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.\n\nNext, \"cries\": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.\n\nMoving to \"promises_companionship\": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.\n\nThen, \"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"runs_away\": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"refuses_entry\": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).\n\n\"opens_door\": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).\n\n\"requests_lift\": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"requests_food\": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).\n\n\"shares_meal\": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).\n\ntransforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n

So no tension here.\n\n\"cries\": The princess is upset because she lost her ball, indicating emotional distress, which could imply that her mental health is at risk due to sadness. So maybe `health_at_risk` for the princess.\n\n\"promises_companionship\": She makes a promise under duress of losing her favorite toy, suggesting some level of stress or coercion. This might relate to `prisoner` if she feels trapped by her promise.\n\n\"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball from the deep well, which could be risky for him. So perhaps `life_at_risk` for the frog as he's retrieving it from a dangerous place.\n\n\"runs_away\": She runs away quickly, possibly indicating fear or urgency, so maybe her life is at risk if she doesn't escape, though this might be more emotional than physical.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog insists on entering, which creates tension in the princess. This could be seen as a form of pressure or threat, maybe `life_at_risk` for the princess if she refuses.\n\n\"refuses_entry\": She refuses entry, creating conflict and possibly putting her in a situation where she might face consequences, indicating `life_at_risk`.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king's command adds authority to letting the frog in, which could increase tension for the princess, maybe `prisoner` as she feels forced.\n\n\"opens_door\": Reluctantly opening the door introduces tension as the frog enters her private space. This might imply `health_at_risk` due to stress or anxiety.\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog entering creates ongoing tension in the castle environment, potentially indicating that characters feel their health is at risk due to discomfort.\n\n\"requests_lift\": Requesting to be lifted up close could make the princess uncomfortable, suggesting her health might be at risk due to stress.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": Lifting the frog onto the table adds physical proximity, which might increase the princess's tension, indicating `health_at_risk`.\n\n\"requests_food\": Sharing food together creates social tension and discomfort for the princess, possibly affecting her health.\n\n\"shares_meal\": Eating together reluctantly could imply ongoing stress or anxiety for the princess, indicating `health_at_risk`.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": Asking to sleep in her bed is a significant invasion of privacy, which might make the princess feel unsafe, indicating `life_at_risk` or `prisoner`.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": Throwing the frog indicates extreme frustration and urgency, suggesting that both characters are at risk of harm.\n\n\"transforms_into_prince\": The

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify the postconditions. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions shouldn't be the same as them.

Starting with "loses_ball": This event doesn't directly involve another character, so no change in emotional links or tensions. But since the princess is upset, maybe her stress increases, affecting health.

"cries": Crying might lead to some stress relief, reducing tension related to health risks.

"promises_companionship": Making a promise could reduce feelings of being trapped, freeing the princess from the pressure, thus resolving prisoner tension.

"retrieves_ball": Successfully retrieving the ball removes the immediate risk the frog was in, so life_at_risk is resolved.

"runs_away": Running away quickly might increase her stress or anxiety, impacting health.

"knocks_on_door": The persistent knocking could create ongoing stress for the princess, affecting her health.

"refuses_entry": Refusing entry creates conflict and ongoing tension, possibly increasing stress levels.

"commands_obedience": The king's command might reduce the feeling of being trapped as the princess follows orders.

"opens_door": Opening the door after hesitation reduces immediate tension but introduces new stressors from the frog's presence.

"enters_castle": The frog entering creates a new dynamic, possibly increasing health-related tensions due to discomfort.

"requests_lift": Lifting the frog might create physical or emotional strain, affecting health.

"lifts_to_table": Being close increases social tension and stress, impacting health.

"requests_food": Sharing food could ease some tension but also introduce discomfort, affecting health.

"shares_meal": Eating together might reduce some stress but overall keeps health-related tensions present.

"requests_sleep": Requesting to sleep together after previous events might increase life_at_risk tension due to potential conflict.

"throws_against_wall": Throwing the frog could lead to immediate harm, increasing life_at_risk tension for both characters.

"transforms_into_prince": Transformation resolves all existing tensions as the spell is broken and the princess feels relief.

time=2025-04-16T10:17:07.520-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.\n\nFirst, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.\n\nWhen the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.\n\nThe king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.\n\nThroughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.\n\nI need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cries\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"retrieves_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"refuses_entry\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"commands_obedience\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"king\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_castle\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_lift\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lifts_to_table\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_food\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"shares_meal\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_sleep\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.\n\nNext, \"cries\": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.\n\nMoving to \"promises_companionship\": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.\n\nThen, \"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"runs_away\": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"refuses_entry\": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).\n\n\"opens_door\": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).\n\n\"requests_lift\": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"requests_food\": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).\n\n\"shares_meal\": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).\n\ntransforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify the postconditions. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions shouldn't be the same as them.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This event doesn't directly involve another character, so no change in emotional links or tensions. But since the princess is upset, maybe her stress increases, affecting health.\n\n\"cries\": Crying might lead to some stress relief, reducing tension related to health risks.\n\n\"promises_companionship\": Making a promise could reduce feelings of being trapped, freeing the princess from the pressure, thus resolving prisoner tension.\n\n\"retrieves_ball\": Successfully retrieving the ball removes the immediate risk the frog was in, so life_at_risk is resolved.\n\n\"runs_away\": Running away quickly might increase her stress or anxiety, impacting health.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The persistent knocking could create ongoing stress for the princess, affecting her health.\n\n\"refuses_entry\": Refusing entry creates conflict and ongoing tension, possibly increasing stress levels.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king's command might reduce the feeling of being trapped as the princess follows orders.\n\n\"opens_door\": Opening the door after hesitation reduces immediate tension but introduces new stressors from the frog's presence.\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog entering creates a new dynamic, possibly increasing health-related tensions due to discomfort.\n\n\"requests_lift\": Lifting the frog might create physical or emotional strain, affecting health.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": Being close increases social tension and stress, impacting health.\n\n\"requests_food\": Sharing food could ease some tension but also introduce discomfort, affecting health.\n\n\"shares_meal\": Eating together might reduce some stress but overall keeps health-related tensions present.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": Requesting to sleep together after previous events might increase life_at_risk tension due to potential conflict.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": Throwing the frog could lead to immediate harm, increasing life_at_risk tension for both characters.\n\n\"transforms_into_prince\": Transformation resolves all existing tensions as the spell is broken and the princess feels relief.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, let's go through each action to ensure logical consistency. I need to check that `n_characters` matches the number of characters in preconditions and postconditions. Also, make sure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions.

Starting with "loses_ball": Only the princess is involved, so `n_characters` is 1. No emotional links, so preconditions are empty. Postconditions only affect her health, which makes sense.

"cries": Again, only the princess, and postconditions resolve health tension. Logical.

"promises_companionship": Both princess and frog are involved, so `n_characters` is 2. Preconditions have non-romantic link from princess to frog with magnitude 1. Postconditions free prisoner tension, which makes sense as she fulfills her promise.

"retrieves_ball": Frog retrieves the ball alone, so `n_characters` remains 1. Resolves life_at_risk for the frog in postconditions.

"runs_away": Princess runs away, affecting her health in postconditions by increasing health_at_risk.

"knocks_on_door": Frog knocks, creating tension for princess's health.

"refuses_entry": Princess refuses, increasing life_at_risk tension.

"commands_obedience": King commands princess, freeing prisoner tension as she follows orders.

"opens_door": Princess opens door, resolving her health tension.

"enters_castle": Frog enters, causing ongoing health_at_risk for princess.

"requests_lift": Frog requests lift from princess, causing health_at_risk.

"lifts_to_table": Princess lifts frog, maintaining health_at_risk.

"requests_food": Frog requests food, affecting princess's health.

"shares_meal": Meal shared, but health_at_risk remains.

"requests_sleep": Frog requests sleep, increasing life_at_risk for princess.

"throws_against_wall": Princess throws frog, causing life_at_risk.

"transforms_into_prince": Transformation resolves life_at_risk as spell breaks.

I need to ensure that all emotional links are correctly typed as 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and that `from` and `to` keys only use 'a' or 'b'. Also, check that each action has at least one postcondition and no duplicates between preconditions and postconditions.

time=2025-04-16T10:18:19.883-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nn old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\" \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,\" said she—\"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\"\n\nThe frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—-if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.\" She, however, thought, \"How the silly frog does talk! He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with thee. I can't run as thou canst.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what art thou so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with thee?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\nYesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside thee.\" She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\" Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with beautiful kind eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this story about the princess and the frog. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me break down the story step by step.\n\nFirst, the princess loses her golden ball down a well. She starts crying because she's upset, which shows her emotional state. Then a frog appears and offers help in exchange for companionship. This sets up a non-romantic emotional link at first since it's more about friendship or companionship.\n\nWhen the frog retrieves the ball, the princess is relieved but doesn't keep her promise. She runs away, showing that she doesn't value their agreement emotionally yet. The next day, the frog comes to the castle and insists on joining her, which creates tension because she's clearly uncomfortable. This is where the emotional link starts turning into a romantic one as the story progresses.\n\nThe king tells her to let the frog in, so she reluctantly does. They sit together, eat, and he wants to sleep in her bed. She's hesitant, but eventually, after throwing him against the wall, he transforms into a prince. This is where the romantic emotional link solidifies because they end up getting married.\n\nThroughout the story, there are elements of tension like the frog's persistence, the princess's fear, and the transformation breaking the spell. These tensions keep the narrative engaging and drive the plot forward.\n\nI need to make sure each action in JSON correctly captures these moments, focusing on emotional links as non-romantic initially and then romantic. Also, note the tensions such as life_at_risk when the frog is in the well or prisoner as he's trapped until the spell breaks.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured analysis of the story:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cries\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"promises_companionship\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"retrieves_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"runs_away\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"knocks_on_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"refuses_entry\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"commands_obedience\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"king\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"opens_door\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"enters_castle\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_lift\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lifts_to_table\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_food\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"shares_meal\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"requests_sleep\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throws_against_wall\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"frog\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"transforms_into_prince\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"frog\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be either non-romantic or romantic, and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This is an event that triggers the princess's emotional state but doesn't involve another character directly, so no emotional link precondition here.\n\nNext, \"cries\": The princess is upset about losing her ball. Her crying is driven by distress towards the situation, not necessarily directed at another character, so again, no specific emotional link needed.\n\nMoving to \"promises_companionship\": Here, the princess makes a promise to the frog in exchange for help. This indicates a non-romantic link with some level of commitment or obligation, maybe magnitude 1.\n\nThen, \"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball because of the promise made by the princess. The frog's action is based on trust, so there might be an emotional link from frog to princess as trust (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"runs_away\": The princess runs away after getting her ball back. This suggests she doesn't want the frog around, indicating a negative non-romantic link, maybe -1.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog wants to fulfill their agreement. This is based on trust from the frog towards the princess (non-romantic, +2).\n\n\"refuses_entry\": The princess refuses entry because she's disgusted or uncomfortable with the frog. That's a negative non-romantic link (-2) towards the frog.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king tells her to let the frog in, indicating trust from the king to the princess (non-romantic, +1).\n\n\"opens_door\": She opens the door reluctantly, still showing discomfort or fear towards the frog (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog enters because of the promise, so trust again from frog to princess (+2).\n\n\"requests_lift\": The frog asks to be lifted up, indicating affectionate companionship. This could be a romantic link starting to form from frog to princess, maybe +1.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": The princess does it unwillingly, showing her hesitation or discomfort (non-romantic, -1).\n\n\"requests_food\": The frog wants to share food together, showing affection and indicating the start of a romantic bond towards the princess (+2).\n\n\"shares_meal\": They eat together reluctantly. Maybe she's starting to feel some positive non-romantic link but not fully yet.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": The frog asks to sleep with her, which is a more intimate request. This could imply romantic feelings from the frog towards the princess (+3), indicating a stronger bond.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": She throws him out of frustration and disgust (non-romantic, -2).\n\ntransforms_into_prince: This action changes their relationship dynamic to romantic as they get married, so a strong positive romantic link is formed after this event.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n

related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`. \n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": This event sets off the chain of actions, but by itself doesn't involve tension directly. So no tension here.\n\n\"cries\": The princess is upset because she lost her ball, indicating emotional distress, which could imply that her mental health is at risk due to sadness. So maybe `health_at_risk` for the princess.\n\n\"promises_companionship\": She makes a promise under duress of losing her favorite toy, suggesting some level of stress or coercion. This might relate to `prisoner` if she feels trapped by her promise.\n\n\"retrieves_ball\": The frog retrieves the ball from the deep well, which could be risky for him. So perhaps `life_at_risk` for the frog as he's retrieving it from a dangerous place.\n\n\"runs_away\": She runs away quickly, possibly indicating fear or urgency, so maybe her life is at risk if she doesn't escape, though this might be more emotional than physical.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The frog insists on entering, which creates tension in the princess. This could be seen as a form of pressure or threat, maybe `life_at_risk` for the princess if she refuses.\n\n\"refuses_entry\": She refuses entry, creating conflict and possibly putting her in a situation where she might face consequences, indicating `life_at_risk`.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king's command adds authority to letting the frog in, which could increase tension for the princess, maybe `prisoner` as she feels forced.\n\n\"opens_door\": Reluctantly opening the door introduces tension as the frog enters her private space. This might imply `health_at_risk` due to stress or anxiety.\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog entering creates ongoing tension in the castle environment, potentially indicating that characters feel their health is at risk due to discomfort.\n\n\"requests_lift\": Requesting to be lifted up close could make the princess uncomfortable, suggesting her health might be at risk due to stress.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": Lifting the frog onto the table adds physical proximity, which might increase the princess's tension, indicating `health_at_risk`.\n\n\"requests_food\": Sharing food together creates social tension and discomfort for the princess, possibly affecting her health.\n\n\"shares_meal\": Eating together reluctantly could imply ongoing stress or anxiety for the princess, indicating `health_at_risk`.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": Asking to sleep in her bed is a significant invasion of privacy, which might make the princess feel unsafe, indicating `life_at_risk` or `prisoner`.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": Throwing the frog indicates extreme frustration and urgency, suggesting that both characters are at risk of harm.\n\n\"transforms_into_prince\": The transformation releases tension as the spell is broken, so no specific tension here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify the postconditions. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action.

risks.\n\n\"promises_companionship\": Making a promise could reduce feelings of being trapped, freeing the princess from the pressure, thus resolving prisoner tension.\n\n\"retrieves_ball\": Successfully retrieving the ball removes the immediate risk the frog was in, so life_at_risk is resolved.\n\n\"runs_away\": Running away quickly might increase her stress or anxiety, impacting health.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": The persistent knocking could create ongoing stress for the princess, affecting her health.\n\n\"refuses_entry\": Refusing entry creates conflict and ongoing tension, possibly increasing stress levels.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": The king's command might reduce the feeling of being trapped as the princess follows orders.\n\n\"opens_door\": Opening the door after hesitation reduces immediate tension but introduces new stressors from the frog's presence.\n\n\"enters_castle\": The frog entering creates a new dynamic, possibly increasing health-related tensions due to discomfort.\n\n\"requests_lift\": Lifting the frog might create physical or emotional strain, affecting health.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": Being close increases social tension and stress, impacting

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's go through each action to ensure logical consistency. I need to check that `n_characters` matches the number of characters in preconditions and postconditions. Also, make sure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions.\n\nStarting with \"loses_ball\": Only the princess is involved, so `n_characters` is 1. No emotional links, so preconditions are empty. Postconditions only affect her health, which makes sense.\n\n\"cries\": Again, only the princess, and postconditions resolve health tension. Logical.\n\n\"promises_companionship\": Both princess and frog are involved, so `n_characters` is 2. Preconditions have non-romantic link from princess to frog with magnitude 1. Postconditions free prisoner tension, which makes sense as she fulfills her promise.\n\n\"retrieves_ball\": Frog retrieves the ball alone, so `n_characters` remains 1. Resolves life_at_risk for the frog in postconditions.\n\n\"runs_away\": Princess runs away, affecting her health in postconditions by increasing health_at_risk.\n\n\"knocks_on_door\": Frog knocks, creating tension for princess's health.\n\n\"refuses_entry\": Princess refuses, increasing life_at_risk tension.\n\n\"commands_obedience\": King commands princess, freeing prisoner tension as she follows orders.\n\n\"opens_door\": Princess opens door, resolving her health tension.\n\n\"enters_castle\": Frog enters, causing ongoing health_at_risk for princess.\n\n\"requests_lift\": Frog requests lift from princess, causing health_at_risk.\n\n\"lifts_to_table\": Princess lifts frog, maintaining health_at_risk.\n\n\"requests_food\": Frog requests food, affecting princess's health.\n\n\"shares_meal\": Meal shared, but health_at_risk remains.\n\n\"requests_sleep\": Frog requests sleep, increasing life_at_risk for princess.\n\n\"throws_against_wall\": Princess throws frog, causing life_at_risk.\n\n\"transforms_into_prince\": Transformation resolves life_at_risk as spell breaks.\n\nI need to ensure that all emotional links are correctly typed as 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and that `from` and `to` keys only use 'a' or 'b'. Also, check that each action has at least one postcondition and no duplicates between preconditions and postconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"loses_ball\",\n

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user correct their JSON object. They mentioned an error when extracting data related to the key 'from'. Let me check what's wrong.

Looking at their previous response, I see that in some postconditions, they have "tensions" without specifying "type", "from", and "to". For example:

```json
                {
                    "type": "prisoner_freed"
                }
```

This is incomplete because each tension must include "type", "from", and "to". The same issue appears with other tensions like "life_normal".

Also, in the action "promises_companionship", they have:

```json
            "tensions": [
                {
                    "type": "prisoner_freed"
                }
            ]
```

Here, "prisoner_freed" should be under "normal_tensions". But the user didn't include a key for normal tensions. Instead, they used "tensions", which isn't correct.

Additionally, in some actions like "cries" and "commands_obedience", they have:

```json
            "tensions": [
                {
                    "type": "health_normal"
                }
            ]
```

But this should be under a separate key, not mixed with regular tensions. So I need to adjust the structure.

Furthermore, each tension must specify who is affected ("from" and "to"). For example, when resolving "life_at_risk", it should indicate which character's life is no longer at risk.

I'll restructure the JSON to include all necessary keys for both emotional links and tensions. I'll also ensure that normal tensions are correctly handled by including a separate key if needed or properly specifying them under "tensions".

Let me go through each action:

1. **loses_ball**: No changes needed; it's correct.
2. **cries**: The postconditions resolve health tension for the princess, so set "from": "a", "to": "b".
3. **promises_companionship**: Resolve prisoner tension by setting "type": "prisoner_freed", and specify "from" and "to".
4. **retrieves_ball**: Resolve life_at_risk for the frog.
5. **runs_away**: Increase health_at_risk for the princess.
6. **knocks_on_door**: Affect princess's health.
7. **refuses_entry**: Increase life_at_risk for princess.
8. **commands_obedience**: Resolve prisoner tension for princess.
9. **opens_door**: Resolve health tension for princess.
10. **enters_castle**: Increase health_at_risk for princess.
11. **requests_lift**: Affect princess's health.
12. **lifts_to_table**: Maintain health_at_risk.
13. **requests_food**: Affect princess's health.
14. **shares_meal**: Keep health_at_risk.
15. **requests_sleep**: Increase life_at_risk for princess.
16. **throws_against_wall**: Increase life_at_risk.
17. **transforms_into_prince**: Resolve life_at_risk.

I'll ensure each tension includes "type", "from", and "to". Also, separate normal tensions if necessary or correctly specify them under the main "tensions" key with appropriate details.

Finally, I'll validate the JSON syntax to ensure all brackets and commas are correct.
