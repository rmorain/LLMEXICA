<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, let me start by thinking about what I know regarding the sun's movement. From what I've learned before, the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west because of Earth's rotation from west to east. But wait, maybe that's not always the case? Are there any situations where the sun could rise in the west?

I remember hearing something about the Earth's axis tilt causing seasons, but does that affect the direction the sun rises? Maybe near the poles or something? Or is it more about the time of year affecting how far north or south the sunrise is. Also, I think during solstices, the sunrise points are at their extreme positions, but still within east and west, just varying degrees.

Wait, there's also the concept of the Earth's rotation causing the apparent movement of the sun from east to west in the sky each day. So, if we consider that, the sun should always rise in the east. But could there be a scenario where it seems like the sun is rising in the west? Maybe during certain atmospheric conditions or optical illusions? I'm not sure about that.

Another thought: perhaps near the poles, especially the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the sun can stay above or below the horizon for extended periods. In some cases, like during the midnight sun, the sun remains visible all day. But does that make it appear to rise in the west? I'm not certain. It might just hover around without setting, so maybe the direction isn't east or west as we typically perceive.

Also, considering Earth's orbit around the Sun, our planet's position relative to the stars changes throughout the year, but that affects the constellations visible at night rather than the sun's rising direction. So I don't think that impacts whether the sun rises in the west.

Wait, could it be that in some cultural or mythological contexts, people talk about the sun rising in the west as a metaphor or part of a story? Maybe in some religious or folklore narratives, but that's not about actual astronomical events.

Another angle: maybe during an eclipse or some rare celestial event, does the sun appear to rise from a different direction? I don't think so; eclipses just make the Sun partially or fully obscured, not change its rising direction.

Wait, what about if you're moving towards the west really fast, like on a plane or spaceship, could that make the sun appear to rise in the west? From a relativistic perspective, maybe, but that's more of a perception due to high-speed travel rather than the actual sunrise direction from Earth's frame of reference.

So putting it all together, I don't think there's any situation on Earth where the sun actually rises in the west. It always comes up in the east and sets in the west due to our planet's rotation. The only exceptions might be near the poles during certain times of the year when the sun doesn't set or rise for months, but that still wouldn't make it rise in the west; it would just stay above or below the horizon.

Therefore, based on my understanding and reasoning, the answer should be no.

No.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.

Looking through the story step by step:

1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.

2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.

3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.

4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.

5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.

6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.

7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).

8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.

9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.

10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).

11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.

12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.

13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).

14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.

15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.

16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.

17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).

18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.

So, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.

I'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.

time=2025-04-02T13:38:06.825-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.\n\nLooking through the story step by step:\n\n1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.\n\n3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.\n\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.\n\n6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.\n\n7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).\n\n8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.\n\n9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.\n\n10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).\n\n11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.\n\n12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.\n\n13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).\n\n14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.\n\n15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.\n\n16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.\n\n17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).\n\n18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.\n\nSo, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.\n\nI'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured analysis of the story's key events, focusing on emotional links and narrative tensions:\n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**  \n   - **Action**: `storm_damage_bridge`\n   - **Tension**: Environmental setup leading to subsequent health risks.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**  \n   - **Action**: `bridge_collapse_injuring_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `-`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Health at risk.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_saves_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Friendship/Love.\n\n4. **Gratitude from Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_realizes_princess_saved_life`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Emotional Link**: Respect/Admiration.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `enemy_kidnaps_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Enemy`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Prisoner/Life at risk.\n\n6. **Jaguar_Knight Rescues Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_rescues_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Love.\n\n7. **Romantic Moment and Tattoo Discovery**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_recognizes_jaguar_knight_tattoo`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions (love vs. hatred).\n\n8. **Ambivalent Feelings**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_feels_ambivalent_towards_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight's Death**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_kills_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\n10. **Princess's Suicide**  \n    - **Action**: `princess_commits_suicide`\n    - **Subject**: `Princess`\n    - **Object**: `-`\n    - **n_characters**: 1\n    - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional dynamics and tensions, providing a clear narrative structure.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

<think>
Okay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.

The user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.

Alright, looking at the example, it starts with "Sto ;1" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like "Eagle_Knight Actor", "Jaguar_Knight Actor", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format "<Subject> <Action> <Object>".

So, my approach should be:

1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.
2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.

I need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON. Also, I should avoid adding extra information not present in the JSON.

Let me start by identifying all characters from the JSON:

- Tlaloc
- Jaguar_Knight
- Princess
- Enemy
- Quetzalcoatl
- Huitzilopochtli
- Tonatiuh

Next, I'll go through each action and convert it accordingly. For example, the first action is "Tlaloc Sends Storm". In DPS, this would be "Tlaloc Sends_Storm".

I need to ensure that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly. If an action has both subject and object, like "Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds", it should follow the "<Subject> <Action> <Object>" format.

Also, I have to make sure that all characters are listed as actors at the beginning of the DPS.

Alright, putting this together, I'll start with the header, list all characters, and then sequentially add each action based on the JSON.

time=2025-04-02T13:38:29.285-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY.

An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.\n\nThe user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.\n\nAlright, looking at the example, it starts with \"Sto ;1\" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like \"Eagle_Knight Actor\", \"Jaguar_Knight Actor\", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\".\n\nSo, my approach should be:\n\n1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.\n2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.\n\nI need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON. Also, I should avoid adding extra information not present in the JSON.\n\nLet me start by identifying all characters from the JSON:\n\n- Tlaloc\n- Jaguar_Knight\n- Princess\n- Enemy\n- Quetzalcoatl\n- Huitzilopochtli\n- Tonatiuh\n\nNext, I'll go through each action and convert it accordingly. For example, the first action is \"Tlaloc Sends Storm\". In DPS, this would be \"Tlaloc Sends_Storm\".\n\nI need to ensure that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly. If an action has both subject and object, like \"Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds\", it should follow the \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\" format.\n\nAlso, I have to make sure that all characters are listed as actors at the beginning of the DPS.\n\nAlright, putting this together, I'll start with the header, list all characters, and then sequentially add each action based on the JSON.\n</think>\n\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nTlaloc Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nPrincess Actor\nEnemy Actor\nQuetzalcoatl Actor\nHuitzilopochtli Actor\nTonatiuh Actor\n\nTlaloc Sends_Storm\nJaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge\nBridge Collapses_Injuring Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Knows_Jaguar_Knight_Could_Die\nPrincess Prepares_Curative_Plant\nPrincess Applies_Curative_Plant_To Jaguar_Knight's_Wounds\nJaguar_Knight Recuperates\nEnemy Kidnaps_Princess\nEnemy Ties_Princess_To_Rock\nEnemy Plans_To_Kill_Princess_At_Midnight\nJaguar_Knight Decides_To_Rescue_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Prays_To_Quetzalcoatl\nPrincess Confronts_Enemy\nEnemy Attacks_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Searches_For_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Finds_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Throws_Dust_In_Enemy's_Face\nJaguar_Knight Stabs_Enemy_With_Dagger\nJaguar_Knight Takes_Enemy's_Heart\nJaguar_Knight Liberates_Princess\nPrincess Kisses_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Recognizes_Jaguar_Knight's_Tattoo\nPrincess Feels_Ambivalent_Towards_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Kills_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Commits_Suicide\nTonatiuh Disappears_In_Horizon\n</DPS><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

time=2025-04-02T13:40:29.852-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.\n\nLooking through the story step by step:\n\n1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.\n\n3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.\n\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.\n\n6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.\n\n7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).\n\n8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.\n\n9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.\n\n10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).\n\n11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.\n\n12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.\n\n13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).\n\n14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.\n\n15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.\n\n16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.\n\n17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).\n\n18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.\n\nSo, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.\n\nI'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured analysis of the story's key events, focusing on emotional links and narrative tensions:\n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**  \n   - **Action**: `storm_damage_bridge`\n   - **Tension**: Environmental setup leading to subsequent health risks.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**  \n   - **Action**: `bridge_collapse_injuring_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `-`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Health at risk.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_saves_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Friendship/Love.\n\n4. **Gratitude from Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_realizes_princess_saved_life`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Emotional Link**: Respect/Admiration.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `enemy_kidnaps_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Enemy`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Prisoner/Life at risk.\n\n6. **Jaguar_Knight Rescues Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_rescues_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Love.\n\n7. **Romantic Moment and Tattoo Discovery**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_recognizes_jaguar_knight_tattoo`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions (love vs. hatred).\n\n8. **Ambivalent Feelings**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_feels_ambivalent_towards_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight's Death**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_kills_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\n10. **Princess's Suicide**  \n    - **Action**: `princess_commits_suicide`\n    - **Subject**: `Princess`\n    - **Object**: `-`\n    - **n_characters**: 1\n    - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional dynamics and tensions, providing a clear narrative structure.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.\n\nThe user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.\n\nAlright, looking at the example, it starts with \"Sto ;1\" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like \"Eagle_Knight Actor\", \"Jaguar_Knight Actor\", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\".\n\nSo, my approach should be:\n\n1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.\n2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.\n\nI need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON. Also, I should avoid adding extra information not present in the JSON.\n\nLet me start by identifying all characters from the JSON:\n\n- Tlaloc\n- Jaguar_Knight\n- Princess\n- Enemy\n- Quetzalcoatl\n- Huitzilopochtli\n- Tonatiuh\n\nNext, I'll go through each action and convert it accordingly. For example, the first action is \"Tlaloc Sends Storm\". In DPS, this would be \"Tlaloc Sends_Storm\".\n\nI need to ensure that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly. If an action has both subject and object, like \"Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds\", it should follow the \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\" format.\n\nAlso, I have to make sure that all characters are listed as actors at the beginning of the DPS.\n\nAlright, putting this together, I'll start with the header, list all characters, and then sequentially add each action based on the JSON.\n</think>\n\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nTlaloc Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nPrincess Actor\nEnemy Actor\nQuetzalcoatl Actor\nHuitzilopochtli Actor\nTonatiuh Actor\n\nTlaloc Sends_Storm\nJaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge\nBridge Collapses_Injuring Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Knows_Jaguar_Knight_Could_Die\nPrincess Prepares_Curative_Plant\nPrincess Applies_Curative_Plant_To Jaguar_Knight's_Wounds\nJaguar_Knight Recuperates\nEnemy Kidnaps_Princess\nEnemy Ties_Princess_To_Rock\nEnemy Plans_To_Kill_Princess_At_Midnight\nJaguar_Knight Decides_To_Rescue_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Prays_To_Quetzalcoatl\nPrincess Confronts_Enemy\nEnemy Attacks_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Searches_For_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Finds_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Throws_Dust_In_Enemy's_Face\nJaguar_Knight Stabs_Enemy_With_Dagger\nJaguar_Knight Takes_Enemy's_Heart\nJaguar_Knight Liberates_Princess\nPrincess Kisses_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Recognizes_Jaguar_Knight's_Tattoo\nPrincess Feels_Ambivalent_Towards_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Kills_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Commits_Suicide\nTonatiuh Disappears_In_Horizon\n</DPS><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the provided JSON. The user has instructed that preconditions are optional and take the form of emotional links with a type and magnitude. Each precondition is an object within the `preconditions` key, containing an array of `emotional_links`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one to identify if there's any implied emotional link that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\n1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  \n   - **Action**: `tlaloc_sends_storm`  \n   - **Subject**: `-`  \n   - **Object**: `-`  \n   - No characters involved, so no preconditions related to emotional links.  \n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_tries_to_cross_bridge`  \n   - **Subject**: `jaguar_knight`  \n   - **Object**: `-`  \n   - No direct emotional link needed; it's more of a necessity.  \n\n3. **Bridge Collapses_Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `bridge_collapses_injuring_jaguar_knight`  \n   - **Subject**: `-`  \n   - **Object**: `jaguar_knight`  \n   - Environmental action, no emotional link preconditions.  \n\n4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight_Could_Die**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_knows_jaguar_knight_could_die`  \n   - **Subject**: `princess`  \n   - **Object**: `-`  \n   - Implies concern for Jaguar_Knight, so a positive emotional link of friendship or love.  \n\n5. **Princess Prepares_Curative_Plant**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_prepares_curative_plant`  \n   - **Subject**: `princess`  \n   - **Object**: `-`  \n   - Her action to save him suggests a positive emotional link towards Jaguar_Knight.  \n\n6. **Princess Applies_Curative_Plant_To_Jaguar_Knight's_Wounds**  \n   - **Action**:

Okay, so now I need to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has instructed that preconditions can include both emotional links and tensions. For tensions, they want me to identify what kind of tension must exist for an action to make sense.

First, let's recall the types of tensions defined:

1. **character_dead**
2. **life_at_risk**
3. **health_at_risk**
4. **prisoner**
5. **clashing_emotions**
6. **love_competition**

I'll go through each action and determine if there are any implied tensions that must exist for the action to occur.

1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  
   - No characters directly involved, so no tension preconditions.

2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  
   - His attempt leads to an accident, implying his life or health is at risk.

3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  
   - Directly causes a health risk for Jaguar_Knight.

4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  
   - Implies that Jaguar_Knight's life is at risk, so Princess acts to save him.

5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  
   - Her action is a response to Jaguar_Knight's health being at risk.

6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  
   - Addresses the health risk and life at risk tensions.

7. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**  
   - Result of Princess's actions, so no ongoing tension here.

8. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  
   - Creates a prisoner tension for Princess.

9. **Enemy Ties Princess To Rock**  
   - Reinforces the prisoner and life at risk tensions.

10. **Enemy Plans To Kill Princess At Midnight**  
    - Escalates the life at risk tension.

11. **Jaguar_Knight Decides To Rescue Princess**  
    - Driven by the prisoner and life at risk tensions involving Princess.

12. **Jaguar_Knight Prays To Quetzalcoatl**  
    - No direct tension, more of a personal action.

13. **Princess Confronts Enemy**  
    - Her confrontation arises from being a prisoner and her life being at risk.

14. **Enemy Attacks Princess**  
    - Directly increases the life at risk tension for Princess.

15. **Jaguar_Knight Searches For Enemy**  
    - Motivated by rescuing Princess, so prisoner and life at risk tensions.

16. **Jaguar_Knight Finds Enemy**  
    - Part of the rescue mission to relieve prisoner and life at risk tensions.

17. **Jaguar_Knight Throws Dust In Enemy's Face**  
    - Action taken to neutralize the threat, implying ongoing tensions.

18. **Jaguar_Knight Stabs Enemy With Dagger**  
    - Leads to Enemy's death, creating a character_dead tension.

19. **Jaguar_Knight Takes Enemy's Heart**  
    - Ritualistic action following Enemy's death, so character_dead applies.

20. **Jaguar_Knight Liberates Princess**  
    - Resolves the prisoner tension for Princess.

21. **Princess Kisses Jaguar_Knight**  
    - No direct tension; it's an emotional link action.

22. **Princess Recognizes Jaguar_Knight's Tattoo**  
    - This realization introduces clashing emotions in Princess.

23. **Princess Feels Ambivalent Towards Jaguar_Knight**  
    - Directly a clashing_emotions tension for Princess.

24. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**  
    - Results in Jaguar_Knight's death, so character_dead tension.

25. **Princess Commits Suicide**  
    - Her death adds to the character_dead tension.

26. **Tonatiuh Disappears In Horizon**  
    - No direct tension; it's an environmental action.

Now, I'll update each action in the JSON with these inferred tensions under preconditions.

time=2025-04-02T13:42:29.686-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.\n\nLooking through the story step by step:\n\n1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.\n\n3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.\n\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.\n\n6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.\n\n7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).\n\n8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.\n\n9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.\n\n10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).\n\n11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.\n\n12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.\n\n13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).\n\n14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.\n\n15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.\n\n16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.\n\n17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).\n\n18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.\n\nSo, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.\n\nI'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured analysis of the story's key events, focusing on emotional links and narrative tensions:\n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**  \n   - **Action**: `storm_damage_bridge`\n   - **Tension**: Environmental setup leading to subsequent health risks.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**  \n   - **Action**: `bridge_collapse_injuring_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `-`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Health at risk.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_saves_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Friendship/Love.\n\n4. **Gratitude from Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_realizes_princess_saved_life`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Emotional Link**: Respect/Admiration.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `enemy_kidnaps_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Enemy`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Prisoner/Life at risk.\n\n6. **Jaguar_Knight Rescues Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_rescues_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Love.\n\n7. **Romantic Moment and Tattoo Discovery**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_recognizes_jaguar_knight_tattoo`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions (love vs. hatred).\n\n8. **Ambivalent Feelings**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_feels_ambivalent_towards_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight's Death**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_kills_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\n10. **Princess's Suicide**  \n    - **Action**: `princess_commits_suicide`\n    - **Subject**: `Princess`\n    - **Object**: `-`\n    - **n_characters**: 1\n    - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional dynamics and tensions, providing a clear narrative structure.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.\n\nThe user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.\n\nAlright, looking at the example, it starts with \"Sto ;1\" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like \"Eagle_Knight Actor\", \"Jaguar_Knight Actor\", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\".\n\nSo, my approach should be:\n\n1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.\n2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.\n\nI need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON. Also, I should avoid adding extra information not present in the JSON.\n\nLet me start by identifying all characters from the JSON:\n\n- Tlaloc\n- Jaguar_Knight\n- Princess\n- Enemy\n- Quetzalcoatl\n- Huitzilopochtli\n- Tonatiuh\n\nNext, I'll go through each action and convert it accordingly. For example, the first action is \"Tlaloc Sends Storm\". In DPS, this would be \"Tlaloc Sends_Storm\".\n\nI need to ensure that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly. If an action has both subject and object, like \"Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds\", it should follow the \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\" format.\n\nAlso, I have to make sure that all characters are listed as actors at the beginning of the DPS.\n\nAlright, putting this together, I'll start with the header, list all characters, and then sequentially add each action based on the JSON.\n</think>\n\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nTlaloc Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nPrincess Actor\nEnemy Actor\nQuetzalcoatl Actor\nHuitzilopochtli Actor\nTonatiuh Actor\n\nTlaloc Sends_Storm\nJaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge\nBridge Collapses_Injuring Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Knows_Jaguar_Knight_Could_Die\nPrincess Prepares_Curative_Plant\nPrincess Applies_Curative_Plant_To Jaguar_Knight's_Wounds\nJaguar_Knight Recuperates\nEnemy Kidnaps_Princess\nEnemy Ties_Princess_To_Rock\nEnemy Plans_To_Kill_Princess_At_Midnight\nJaguar_Knight Decides_To_Rescue_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Prays_To_Quetzalcoatl\nPrincess Confronts_Enemy\nEnemy Attacks_Princess\nJaguar_Knight Searches_For_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Finds_Enemy\nJaguar_Knight Throws_Dust_In_Enemy's_Face\nJaguar_Knight Stabs_Enemy_With_Dagger\nJaguar_Knight Takes_Enemy's_Heart\nJaguar_Knight Liberates_Princess\nPrincess Kisses_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Recognizes_Jaguar_Knight's_Tattoo\nPrincess Feels_Ambivalent_Towards_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Kills_Jaguar_Knight\nPrincess Commits_Suicide\nTonatiuh Disappears_In_Horizon\n</DPS><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the provided JSON. The user has instructed that preconditions are optional and take the form of emotional links with a type and magnitude. Each precondition is an object within the `preconditions` key, containing an array of `emotional_links`.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one to identify if there's any implied emotional

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so now I need to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has instructed that preconditions can include both emotional links and tensions. For tensions, they want me to identify what kind of tension must exist for an action to make sense.\n\nFirst, let's recall the types of tensions defined:\n\n1. **character_dead**\n2. **life_at_risk**\n3. **health_at_risk**\n4. **prisoner**\n5. **clashing_emotions**\n6. **love_competition**\n\nI'll go through each action and determine if there are any implied tensions that must exist for the action to occur.\n\n1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  \n   - No characters directly involved, so no tension preconditions.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  \n   - His attempt leads to an accident, implying his life or health is at risk.\n\n3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - Directly causes a health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  \n   - Implies that Jaguar_Knight's life is at risk, so Princess acts to save him.\n\n5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  \n   - Her action is a response to Jaguar_Knight's health being at risk.\n\n6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  \n   - Addresses the health risk and life at risk tensions.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**  \n   - Result of Princess's actions, so no ongoing tension here.\n\n8. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - Creates a prisoner tension for Princess.\n\n9. **Enemy Ties Princess To Rock**  \n   - Reinforces the prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n10. **Enemy Plans To Kill Princess At Midnight**  \n    - Escalates the life at risk tension.\n\n11. **Jaguar_Knight Decides To Rescue Princess**  \n    - Driven by the prisoner and life at risk tensions involving Princess.\n\n12. **Jaguar_Knight Prays To Quetzalcoatl**  \n    - No direct tension, more of a personal action.\n\n13. **Princess Confronts Enemy**  \n    - Her confrontation arises from being a prisoner and her life being at risk.\n\n14. **Enemy Attacks Princess**  \n    - Directly increases the life at risk tension for Princess.\n\n15. **Jaguar_Knight Searches For Enemy**  \n    - Motivated by rescuing Princess, so prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n16. **Jaguar_Knight Finds Enemy**  \n    - Part of the rescue mission to relieve prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n17. **Jaguar_Knight Throws Dust In Enemy's Face**  \n    - Action taken to neutralize the threat, implying ongoing tensions.\n\n18. **Jaguar_Knight Stabs Enemy With Dagger**  \n    - Leads to Enemy's death, creating a character_dead tension.\n\n19. **Jaguar_Knight Takes Enemy's Heart**  \n    - Ritualistic action following Enemy's death, so character_dead applies.\n\n20. **Jaguar_Knight Liberates Princess**  \n    - Resolves the prisoner tension for Princess.\n\n21. **Princess Kisses Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - No direct tension; it's an emotional link action.\n\n22. **Princess Recognizes Jaguar_Knight's Tattoo**  \n    - This realization introduces clashing emotions in Princess.\n\n23. **Princess Feels Ambivalent Towards Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - Directly a clashing_emotions tension for Princess.\n\n24. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - Results in Jaguar_Knight's death, so character_dead tension.\n\n25. **Princess Commits Suicide**  \n    - Her death adds to the character_dead tension.\n\n26. **Tonatiuh Disappears In Horizon**  \n    - No direct tension; it's an environmental action.\n\nNow, I'll update each action in the JSON with these inferred tensions under preconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tlaloc_sends_storm\",\n    \"n_characters\": 0,\n    \"subject\":

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to add postconditions for each action in the provided JSON. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they shouldn't duplicate preconditions if any exist.

I'll go through each action step by step:

1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  
   - No characters involved, so no emotional links, but introduces a storm which might set up future tensions.

2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  
   - His attempt leads to an accident, risking his life and health, so postconditions include health_at_risk.

3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  
   - Directly causes a health risk for him.

4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  
   - Her concern strengthens her positive emotional link towards him.

5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  
   - Her action shows care, enhancing friendship or love towards Jaguar_Knight.

6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  
   - Resolves health and life risks, freeing him from prisoner tension if any, and strengthens positive emotional links.

7. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**  
   - His recovery normalizes his health and life tensions.

8. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  
   - Creates a prisoner tension for her and possibly fear or anger from her towards Enemy.

9. **Enemy Ties Princess To Rock**  
   - Reinforces the prisoner and life at risk tensions, increases negative emotions towards Enemy.

10. **Enemy Plans To Kill Princess At Midnight**  
    - Escalates life at risk tension, increasing fear or hatred towards Enemy.

11. **Jaguar_Knight Decides To Rescue Princess**  
    - Driven by love for her, aims to resolve prisoner and life at risk tensions.

12. **Jaguar_Knight Prays To Quetzalcoatl**  
    - No direct emotional links, but may relieve personal tensions.

13. **Princess Confronts Enemy**  
    - Her anger increases negative emotions towards Enemy.

14. **Enemy Attacks Princess**  
    - Increases life at risk and negative emotions from her towards him.

15. **Jaguar_Knight Searches For Enemy**  
    - Motivated by love, aims to resolve tensions related to Princess.

16. **Jaguar_Knight Finds Enemy**  
    - Part of the rescue mission, leading to potential resolution of prisoner and life at risk tensions.

17. **Jaguar_Knight Throws Dust In Enemy's Face**  
    - Action taken to neutralize threat, no direct emotional change but affects tension.

18. **Jaguar_Knight Stabs Enemy With Dagger**  
    - Leads to Enemy's death, creating character_dead tension.

19. **Jaguar_Knight Takes Enemy's Heart**  
    - Ritualistic action following Enemy's death, so character_dead applies.

20. **Jaguar_Knight Liberates Princess**  
    - Resolves prisoner and life at risk tensions for her, strengthens positive emotional links.

21. **Princess Kisses Jaguar_Knight**  
    - Strengthens romantic link between them.

22. **Princess Recognizes Jaguar_Knight's Tattoo**  
    - This realization introduces clashing emotions in Princess towards him.

23. **Princess Feels Ambivalent Towards Jaguar_Knight**  
    - Directly causes clashing_emotions tension for her.

24. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**  
    - Results in his death, so character_dead tension, and negative emotional link from her to him.

25. **Princess Commits Suicide**  
    - Her death adds to the character_dead tension, affecting herself.

26. **Tonatiuh Disappears In Horizon**  
    - No direct impact on characters, just environmental.

Now, I'll update each action with these postconditions.

time=2025-04-02T13:45:22.939-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to extract actions related to emotional links and tensions in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main characters: Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc (the god), Enemy, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonatiuh. But for the analysis, I should focus on actions between them that relate to emotional links (friendship or love) and tensions like character death, life at risk, etc.\n\nLooking through the story step by step:\n\n1. Tlaloc sends a storm, damaging the bridge. This causes Jaguar_Knight's injury. So, an action where Tlaloc acts on the bridge, causing damage. That's an environmental action but leads to health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n2. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross and gets injured. His life is at risk because of the bridge collapse.\n\n3. Princess knows he could die and decides to act. She prepares a curative plant and applies it, saving his life. This shows a positive emotional link (friendship or love) from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. Jaguar_Knight realizes Princess saved him, indicating mutual respect or friendship.\n\n5. Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions in the past. This introduces tension of prisoner and possibly love competition if both have feelings for someone.\n\n6. Enemy ties Princess to a rock and plans to kill her at midnight. Life is definitely at risk here.\n\n7. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery but also emotional investment (could be love or friendship).\n\n8. He prays to Quetzalcoatl for wisdom and bravery before acting. This is more of a personal action, not directly relating to others, so maybe not an emotional link.\n\n9. Princess confronts Enemy angrily, leading to volatile emotions. Clashing emotions here because she's angry but also scared or determined.\n\n10. Enemy attacks her without thinking, which escalates the tension (life at risk).\n\n11. Jaguar_Knight starts searching for Enemy, finds him, and attacks. This is a high-tension action with health risks involved.\n\n12. He uses dust to distract, then stabs Enemy, imitates a sacrifice. This leads to Enemy's death, so character dead tension.\n\n13. After killing Enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing his emotional link (love or friendship).\n\n14. Princess admires his bravery, leading her to fall in love with him. Clear romantic emotional link here.\n\n15. They kiss, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions: love and hatred towards the same person.\n\n16. She feels ambivalent, torn between love and hatred. So, clashing emotions tension arises.\n\n17. In anger, Princess kills Jaguar_Knight, leading to his death (character dead).\n\n18. Then she takes her own life with a dagger (another character dead), bleeding out as the sun sets.\n\nSo, I need to map these events into actions with subject, object, n_characters, and action type. Each action should be in snake_case without character names, so generalize them.\n\nI'll go through each event, extract the relevant actions, assign subjects and objects where applicable, count characters involved, and categorize them under emotional links or tensions as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured analysis of the story's key events, focusing on emotional links and narrative tensions:\n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**  \n   - **Action**: `storm_damage_bridge`\n   - **Tension**: Environmental setup leading to subsequent health risks.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**  \n   - **Action**: `bridge_collapse_injuring_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `-`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Health at risk.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_saves_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Friendship/Love.\n\n4. **Gratitude from Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_realizes_princess_saved_life`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Emotional Link**: Respect/Admiration.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `enemy_kidnaps_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Enemy`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Prisoner/Life at risk.\n\n6. **Jaguar_Knight Rescues Princess**  \n   - **Action**: `jaguar_knight_rescues_princess`\n   - **Subject**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **Object**: `Princess`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Emotional Link**: Love.\n\n7. **Romantic Moment and Tattoo Discovery**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_recognizes_jaguar_knight_tattoo`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions (love vs. hatred).\n\n8. **Ambivalent Feelings**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_feels_ambivalent_towards_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `-`\n   - **n_characters**: 1\n   - **Tension**: Clashing emotions.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight's Death**  \n   - **Action**: `princess_kills_jaguar_knight`\n   - **Subject**: `Princess`\n   - **Object**: `Jaguar_Knight`\n   - **n_characters**: 2\n   - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\n10. **Princess's Suicide**  \n    - **Action**: `princess_commits_suicide`\n    - **Subject**: `Princess`\n    - **Object**: `-`\n    - **n_characters**: 1\n    - **Tension**: Character dead.\n\nThis analysis captures the essential emotional dynamics and tensions, providing a clear narrative structure.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the given JSON object into a Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) structure. First, let me understand what DPS is. From the example provided, it looks like DPS is a way to represent stories using actions and characters in a specific syntax.\n\nThe user wants me to map each action from the JSON to this new format, ensuring that the character names and actions match exactly. They also mentioned that if an action doesn't have a subject or object, I should omit those parts in the DPS.\n\nAlright, looking at the example, it starts with \"Sto ;1\" which might be a header indicating the start of the story. Then, it lists all the actors involved, like \"Eagle_Knight Actor\", \"Jaguar_Knight Actor\", etc. After that, it describes the actions in sequence using the format \"<Subject> <Action> <Object>\".\n\nSo, my approach should be:\n\n1. **Extract Characters**: List all unique characters from the JSON.\n2. **List Actions Sequentially**: For each action in the JSON, create a line in DPS syntax, including subject and object if they exist.\n\nI need to make sure that the actions and character names are consistent with those in the JSON.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the provided JSON.

**life_at_risk**\n3. **health_at_risk**\n4. **prisoner**\n5. **clashing_emotions**\n6. **love_competition**\n\nI'll go through each action and determine if there are any implied tensions that must exist for the action to occur.\n\n1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  \n   - No characters directly involved, so no tension preconditions.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  \n   - His attempt leads to an accident, implying his life or health is at risk.\n\n3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - Directly causes a health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  \n   - Implies that Jaguar_Knight's life is at risk, so Princess acts to save him.\n\n5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  \n   - Her action is a response to Jaguar_Knight's health being at risk.\n\n6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  \n   - Addresses the health risk and life at risk tensions.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**  \n   - Result of Princess's actions, so no ongoing tension here.\n\n8. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**  \n   - Creates a prisoner tension for Princess.\n\n9. **Enemy Ties Princess To Rock**  \n   - Reinforces the prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n10. **Enemy Plans To Kill Princess At Midnight**  \n    - Escalates the life at risk tension.\n\n11. **Jaguar_Knight Decides To Rescue Princess**  \n    - Driven by the prisoner and life at risk tensions involving Princess.\n\n12. **Jaguar_Knight Prays To Quetzalcoatl**  \n    - No direct tension, more of a personal action.\n\n13. **Princess Confronts Enemy**  \n    - Her confrontation arises from being a prisoner and her life being at risk.\n\n14. **Enemy Attacks Princess**  \n    - Directly increases the life at risk tension for Princess.\n\n15. **Jaguar_Knight Searches For Enemy**  \n    - Motivated by rescuing Princess, so prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n16. **Jaguar_Knight Finds Enemy**  \n    - Part of the rescue mission to relieve prisoner and life at risk tensions.\n\n17. **Jaguar_Knight Throws Dust In Enemy's Face**  \n    - Action taken to neutralize the threat, implying ongoing tensions.\n\n18. **Jaguar_Knight Stabs Enemy With Dagger**  \n    - Leads to Enemy's death, creating a character_dead tension.\n\n19. **Jaguar_Knight Takes Enemy's Heart**  \n    - Ritualistic action following Enemy's death, so character_dead applies.\n\n20. **Jaguar_Knight Liberates Princess**  \n    - Resolves the prisoner tension for Princess.\n\n21. **Princess Kisses Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - No direct tension; it's an emotional link action.\n\n22. **Princess Recognizes Jaguar_Knight's Tattoo**  \n    - This realization introduces clashing emotions in Princess.\n\n23. **Princess Feels Ambivalent Towards Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - Directly a clashing_emotions tension for Princess.\n\n24. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**  \n    - Results in Jaguar_Knight's death, so character_dead tension.\n\n25. **Princess Commits Suicide**  \n    - Her death adds to the character_dead tension.\n\n26. **Tonatiuh Disappears In Horizon**  \n    - No direct tension; it's an environmental action.\n\nNow, I'll update each action in the JSON with these inferred tensions under preconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tlaloc_sends_storm\",\n    \"n_characters\": 0,\n    \"subject\":

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to add postconditions for each action in the provided JSON. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from the action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they shouldn't duplicate preconditions if any exist.\n\nI'll go through each action step by step:\n\n1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  \n   - No characters involved, so no emotional links, but introduces a storm which might set up future tensions.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  \n   - His attempt leads to an accident, risking his life and health, so postconditions include health_at_risk.\n\n3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  \n   - Directly causes a health risk for him.\n\n4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  \n   - Her concern strengthens her positive emotional link towards him.\n\n5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  \n   - Her action shows care, enhancing friendship or love towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  \n   - Resolves health and life risks, freeing him from prisoner tension if any, and strengthens positive emotional

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to ensure logical consistency in each action by checking that the number of characters (`n_characters`) matches the references in preconditions and postconditions. Also, if a character dies, they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions. Additionally, preconditions and postconditions must not be the same, and `a` should always refer to the subject, while `b` refers to the object.

Starting with the first action:

1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**  
   - `n_characters`: 0  
   - No characters involved, so no emotional links or tensions. This is consistent.

2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**  
   - `n_characters`: 1  
   - Only Jaguar_Knight is involved, so all references should use `a`. The preconditions have a tension involving `a`, and postconditions also use `a`. This seems okay.

3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**  
   - `n_characters`: 1  
   - Similar to above; only Jaguar_Knight is involved, so using `b` here might be inconsistent. Should probably use `a`.

4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**  
   - `n_characters`: 1  
   - Princess is the subject, so all references should be `a`. However, preconditions and postconditions refer to `b`, which doesn't make sense since there's only one character.

5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**  
   - Same issue as above; `n_characters` is 1, but `b` is referenced.

6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**  
   - `n_characters`: 2  
   - Here, Princess (`a`) helps Jaguar_Knight (`b`). This makes sense since both are involved, and references to `a` and `b` are appropriate.

Continuing this process for each action would ensure consistency. For example, in actions where a character dies, like **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**, we need to ensure that postconditions don't assign any new emotional links or tensions to the deceased character (Jaguar_Knight).

I'll need to go through each action, adjust the references of `a` and `b` according to the number of characters involved, and remove any illogical assignments after a character's death.
</think>

To ensure logical consistency in each action, we must verify that the number of characters (`n_characters`) matches the references in both preconditions and postconditions. Here's how we can systematically address this:

### 1. **Tlaloc Sends Storm**
- **n_characters**: 0  
  - No characters involved; no emotional links or tensions. This is consistent.

### 2. **Jaguar_Knight Tries_To_Cross_Bridge**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`) is involved. All references should use `a`. Current setup uses `b` in postconditions, which is inconsistent and needs correction.

### 3. **Bridge Collapses Injuring Jaguar_Knight**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`) is involved. References to `b` are incorrect and should be updated to `a`.

### 4. **Princess Knows_Jaguar_Knight Could Die**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Princess (`a`) is involved. Current references to `b` are inconsistent.

### 5. **Princess Prepares Curative Plant**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Similar issue as above; only `a` should be referenced.

### 6. **Princess Applies Curative Plant To Jaguar_Knight's Wounds**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Princess (`a`) and Jaguar_Knight (`b`). Current references to both are appropriate.

### 7. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`). Postconditions should reference `a`.

### 8. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Enemy (`a`) and Princess (`b`). Current references are appropriate.

### 9. **Enemy Ties Princess To Rock**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - References to both `a` (Enemy) and `b` (Princess) are correct.

### 10. **Enemy Plans To Kill Princess At Midnight**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Enemy (`a`). Current references to `b` need adjustment.

### 11. **Jaguar_Knight Decides To Rescue Princess**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`). References should use `a`.

### 12. **Jaguar_Knight Prays To Quetzalcoatl**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`).

### 13. **Princess Confronts Enemy**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Princess (`a`) and Enemy (`b`). References are appropriate.

### 14. **Enemy Attacks Princess**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Enemy (`a`) and Princess (`b`). Correct references.

### 15. **Jaguar_Knight Searches For Enemy**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`).

### 16. **Jaguar_Knight Finds Enemy**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`).

### 17. **Jaguar_Knight Throws Dust In Enemy's Face**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Jaguar_Knight (`a`) and Enemy (`b`). Correct.

### 18. **Jaguar_Knight Stabs Enemy With Dagger**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Jaguar_Knight (`a`) and Enemy (`b`). Correct.

### 19. **Jaguar_Knight Takes Enemy's Heart**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Jaguar_Knight (`a`).

### 20. **Jaguar_Knight Liberates Princess**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Jaguar_Knight (`a`) and Princess (`b`). Correct.

### 21. **Princess Kisses Jaguar_Knight**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Princess (`a`) and Jaguar_Knight (`b`). Correct.

### 22. **Princess Recognizes Jaguar_Knight's Tattoo**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Princess (`a`).

### 23. **Princess Feels Ambivalent Towards Jaguar_Knight**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Princess (`a`).

### 24. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight**
- **n_characters**: 2  
  - Princess (`a`) and Jaguar_Knight (`b`). After this action, Jaguar_Knight is dead; no further emotional links or tensions should be assigned to him.

### 25. **Princess Commits Suicide**
- **n_characters**: 1  
  - Only Princess (`a`).

### 26. **Tonatiuh Disappears In Horizon**
- **n_characters**: 0  
  - No characters involved; consistent.

---

### Summary of Adjustments Needed:
- For actions with `n_characters`: 1, ensure all references use only `a`.
- Correct inconsistent references where `b` is used for single-character actions.
- After a character's death (e.g., Jaguar_Knight), prevent any new emotional links or tensions from being assigned to the deceased.

By systematically reviewing each action and aligning the references with `n_characters`, we ensure logical consistency throughout the JSON structure.
