Story:  JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:

Okay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.

So, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.

First, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.

I need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.

Starting from the beginning:

1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.
2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).
3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.
4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.
5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.
6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.
7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.
8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.
9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.
10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.

Now, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.

Let me list them:

- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)
- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)
- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)
- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)
Wait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.
But according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.

I'll go through each event and assign the correct action:

1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.
Wait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.

Wait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.

But looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.

Moving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.

Then enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.

Enemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.

Enemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.

So actions would be:

- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)
- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip
- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)
- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'
- Ties her up: 'tie_up'
- Charges against: 'attack'
- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.
- Searches for enemy: 'search'
- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.

After defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'

They kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)

Princess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'

She kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.

Wait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.

So compiling all these:

1. heal (n=2)
2. kidnap (n=2)
3. tie_up (n=2)
4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)
5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.
Wait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.

But in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.

So:

1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight
2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess
3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess
4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)
5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy
6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.
7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess
8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.

Wait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.

Then she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.

Then she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.

She also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.

Wait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.

So I'll list all these actions in order:

1. heal
2. kidnap
3. tie_up
4. attack (enemy charges)
5. search
6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)
7. liberate
8. kiss
9. recognize_tattoo
10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)
11. kill (Princess kills herself)

Wait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.

Alternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.

So maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.

But the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?

Maybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.

So including that as an action.

So final list:

1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)
2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)
3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)
4. attack (enemy charges at her)
5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)
6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)
7. liberate (frees Princess)
8. kiss
9. realize_identity
10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)
11. kill (Princess kills herself)

Now, mapping each to JSON:

Each action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.

Heal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight

Kidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess

Tie_up: same subjects

Attack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess

Search: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)

Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy

Liberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess

Kiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.

Realize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)

Kill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar

Kill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's instructions.
</think>

Here is the structured JSON output based on the provided story:

```json

  {
    "action": "heal",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Princess",
    "object": "Jaguar_Knight"

  },
  {
    "action": "kill",
    "n_characters": 2,
    "subject": "Princess",
    "object": "Jaguar_Knight"
  },
  {
    "action": "kill",
    "n_characters": 1,
    "subject": "Princess",
    "object": "Princess"
  }
]
```

This JSON captures the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions in the narrative, focusing on interactions between characters.

time=2025-04-16T13:40:34.129-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.\n\nSo, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.\n\nI need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.\n2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.\n4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.\n5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.\n6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.\n7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.\n8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.\n9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.\n10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.\n\nNow, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)\n- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)\n- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)\n- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)\nWait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\nBut according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each event and assign the correct action:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.\nWait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.\n\nWait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.\n\nBut looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.\n\nMoving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.\n\nThen enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\n\nEnemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.\n\nEnemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)\n- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip\n- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)\n- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'\n- Ties her up: 'tie_up'\n- Charges against: 'attack'\n- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.\n- Searches for enemy: 'search'\n- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.\n\nAfter defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'\n\nThey kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)\n\nPrincess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'\n\nShe kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.\n\nWait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n1. heal (n=2)\n2. kidnap (n=2)\n3. tie_up (n=2)\n4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)\n5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.\nWait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.\n\nBut in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.\n\nSo:\n\n1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight\n2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess\n3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess\n4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)\n5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy\n6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.\n7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess\n8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.\n\nWait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nThen she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.\n\nThen she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nShe also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.\n\nWait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.\n\nSo I'll list all these actions in order:\n\n1. heal\n2. kidnap\n3. tie_up\n4. attack (enemy charges)\n5. search\n6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)\n7. liberate\n8. kiss\n9. recognize_tattoo\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nWait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.\n\nAlternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.\n\nSo maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.\n\nBut the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?\n\nMaybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.\n\nSo including that as an action.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)\n2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)\n3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)\n4. attack (enemy charges at her)\n5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)\n6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)\n7. liberate (frees Princess)\n8. kiss\n9. realize_identity\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nNow, mapping each to JSON:\n\nEach action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nHeal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight\n\nKidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nTie_up: same subjects\n\nAttack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nSearch: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)\n\nAttack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy\n\nLiberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess\n\nKiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.\n\nRealize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)\n\nKill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar\n\nKill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured JSON output based on the provided story:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions in the narrative, focusing on interactions between characters.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story analysis. The user has provided a JSON structure that includes actions with subjects and objects, and now they want to add preconditions based on emotional links.

First, let me understand what's being asked. For each action, I need to identify if there are any emotional links (either non-romantic or romantic) that must exist between the subject and object for that action to make sense. These emotional links have a magnitude from -3 to 3. 

I'll go through each action one by one.

1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.
   - Why would she heal him? likely because she cares about him, which is a non-romantic link with a positive magnitude, maybe +2 (concern or care).

2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.
   - The enemy's action implies negative feelings towards the Princess, probably non-romantic hatred, so magnitude -3.

3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.
   - Similar to kidnap, it's about the enemy's negative emotions towards her, so another non-romantic link with magnitude -3.

4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Enemy attacks Princess.
   - Again, the enemy's negative feelings drive this action, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.

5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy.
   - He is motivated by a positive emotional link towards Princess, wanting to rescue her. So non-romantic from him to her, maybe +2 (determination).

6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar attacks the Enemy.
   - His motivation is to save Princess, so non-romantic towards her with magnitude +3 (strong determination).

7. **Liberate**: Jaguar frees Princess.
   - His action stems from strong positive feelings towards her, non-romantic, magnitude +3.

8. **Kiss**: Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight.
   - This is a romantic link between them, so type romantic with magnitude +3 (love).

9. **Realize_identity**: Princess realizes Jaguar's identity via tattoo.
   - This leads to negative emotions towards him, non-romantic with magnitude -2 (resentment or betrayal).

10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Princess kills Jaguar_Knight.
    - Driven by negative emotions due to his past actions, non-romantic with magnitude -3 (hatred).

11. **Kill (self)**: Princess kills herself.
    - This is a self-directed action, but the emotional link here would be towards herself, perhaps indicating despair or guilt, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.

Now, for each action in the JSON, I'll add the preconditions section with these inferred emotional links. If an action doesn't have a clear emotional precondition, the array will be empty. However, based on the story, most actions are driven by emotional motivations.

I need to ensure that each emotional link specifies type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b', where 'a' is subject and 'b' is object). If the action involves only one character, like 'kill' towards self, then both from and to would be 'a'.

Let me structure this for each action in the JSON provided.

time=2025-04-16T13:41:24.098-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.\n\nSo, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.\n\nI need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.\n2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.\n4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.\n5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.\n6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.\n7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.\n8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.\n9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.\n10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.\n\nNow, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)\n- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)\n- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)\n- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)\nWait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\nBut according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each event and assign the correct action:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.\nWait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.\n\nWait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.\n\nBut looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.\n\nMoving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.\n\nThen enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\n\nEnemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.\n\nEnemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)\n- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip\n- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)\n- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'\n- Ties her up: 'tie_up'\n- Charges against: 'attack'\n- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.\n- Searches for enemy: 'search'\n- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.\n\nAfter defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'\n\nThey kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)\n\nPrincess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'\n\nShe kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.\n\nWait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n1. heal (n=2)\n2. kidnap (n=2)\n3. tie_up (n=2)\n4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)\n5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.\nWait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.\n\nBut in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.\n\nSo:\n\n1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight\n2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess\n3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess\n4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)\n5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy\n6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.\n7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess\n8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.\n\nWait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nThen she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.\n\nThen she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nShe also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.\n\nWait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.\n\nSo I'll list all these actions in order:\n\n1. heal\n2. kidnap\n3. tie_up\n4. attack (enemy charges)\n5. search\n6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)\n7. liberate\n8. kiss\n9. recognize_tattoo\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nWait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.\n\nAlternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.\n\nSo maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.\n\nBut the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?\n\nMaybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.\n\nSo including that as an action.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)\n2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)\n3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)\n4. attack (enemy charges at her)\n5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)\n6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)\n7. liberate (frees Princess)\n8. kiss\n9. realize_identity\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nNow, mapping each to JSON:\n\nEach action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nHeal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight\n\nKidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nTie_up: same subjects\n\nAttack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nSearch: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)\n\nAttack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy\n\nLiberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess\n\nKiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.\n\nRealize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)\n\nKill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar\n\nKill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured JSON output based on the provided story:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions in the narrative, focusing on interactions between characters.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story analysis. The user has provided a JSON structure that includes actions with subjects and objects, and now they want to add preconditions based on emotional links.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. For each action, I need to identify if there are any emotional links (either non-romantic or romantic) that must exist between the subject and object for that action to make sense. These emotional links have a magnitude from -3 to 3. \n\nI'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Why would she heal him? likely because she cares about him, which is a non-romantic link with a positive magnitude, maybe +2 (concern or care).\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - The enemy's action implies negative feelings towards the Princess, probably non-romantic hatred, so magnitude -3.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Similar to kidnap, it's about the enemy's negative emotions towards her, so another non-romantic link with magnitude -3.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Enemy attacks Princess.\n   - Again, the enemy's negative feelings drive this action, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy.\n   - He is motivated by a positive emotional link towards Princess, wanting to rescue her. So non-romantic from him to her, maybe +2 (determination).\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar attacks the Enemy.\n   - His motivation is to save Princess, so non-romantic towards her with magnitude +3 (strong determination).\n\n7. **Liberate**: Jaguar frees Princess.\n   - His action stems from strong positive feelings towards her, non-romantic, magnitude +3.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight.\n   - This is a romantic link between them, so type romantic with magnitude +3 (love).\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Princess realizes Jaguar's identity via tattoo.\n   - This leads to negative emotions towards him, non-romantic with magnitude -2 (resentment or betrayal).\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Princess kills Jaguar_Knight.\n    - Driven by negative emotions due to his past actions, non-romantic with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess kills herself.\n    - This is a self-directed action, but the emotional link here would be towards herself, perhaps indicating despair or guilt, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\nNow, for each action in the JSON, I'll add the preconditions section with these inferred emotional links. If an action doesn't have a clear emotional precondition, the array will be empty. However, based on the story, most actions are driven by emotional motivations.\n\nI need to ensure that each emotional link specifies type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b', where 'a' is subject and 'b' is object). If the action involves only one character, like 'kill' towards self, then both from and to would be 'a'.\n\nLet me structure this for each action in the JSON provided.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with preconditions added based on inferred emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON now includes preconditions for each action, detailing the necessary emotional links and their magnitudes that drive the characters' actions in the story.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Okay, so now I need to add preconditions related to tensions for each action in the JSON. The user wants me to identify or infer the necessary tensions that must exist for a character to perform an action. These tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.

First, I'll recall what each tension means:
- `character_dead`: A character has died.
- `life_at_risk`: A character's life is in danger.
- `health_at_risk`: A character's health is compromised.
- `prisoner`: A character is being held captive.

I need to go through each action and determine if any of these tensions are preconditions for that action. For example, if a character heals another, it might be because the recipient's health was at risk.

Let me process each action:

1. **Heal (Princess heals Jaguar_Knight)**:
   - Jaguar_Knight was injured from the bridge collapse. So, his health was at risk.
   - Tension: `health_at_risk` from Jaguar_Knight to himself, since he's the one injured.

2. **Kidnap (Enemy kidnaps Princess)**:
   - Kidnapping puts her life at risk and makes her a prisoner.
   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`, both affecting Princess.

3. **Tie_up (Enemy ties Princess)**:
   - This action continues her being a prisoner and her life remains at risk.

4. **Attack (Enemy charges at Princess)**:
   - Directly threatens her life, so `life_at_risk`.

5. **Search (Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy)**:
   - He's searching because the enemy has taken Princess, so preconditions include her being a prisoner and her life at risk.

6. **Attack (Jaguar_Knight attacks Enemy)**:
   - His motivation is to save Princess from danger, so `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`.

7. **Liberate (Jaguar frees Princess)**:
   - This action aims to relieve the tensions of her being a prisoner and her life at risk.

8. **Kiss (Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight)**:
   - No direct tension here; it's an emotional link, so no tensions as preconditions.

9. **Realize_identity (Princess realizes tattoo)**:
   - This leads to tension within Princess but doesn't directly tie to the predefined tension types.

10. **Kill (Princess kills Jaguar_Knight)**:
    - Results in his death, so `character_dead`.

11. **Kill (Princess kills herself)**:
    - She dies, so `character_dead` applied to herself.

Now, for each action, I'll add the tensions as preconditions. If there are no applicable tensions, the array remains empty.

I need to structure this correctly in JSON, ensuring that each tension specifies type, from, and to, using 'a' for subject and 'b' for object.

time=2025-04-16T13:42:26.955-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.\n\nSo, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.\n\nI need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.\n2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.\n4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.\n5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.\n6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.\n7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.\n8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.\n9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.\n10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.\n\nNow, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)\n- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)\n- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)\n- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)\nWait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\nBut according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each event and assign the correct action:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.\nWait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.\n\nWait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.\n\nBut looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.\n\nMoving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.\n\nThen enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\n\nEnemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.\n\nEnemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)\n- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip\n- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)\n- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'\n- Ties her up: 'tie_up'\n- Charges against: 'attack'\n- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.\n- Searches for enemy: 'search'\n- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.\n\nAfter defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'\n\nThey kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)\n\nPrincess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'\n\nShe kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.\n\nWait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n1. heal (n=2)\n2. kidnap (n=2)\n3. tie_up (n=2)\n4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)\n5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.\nWait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.\n\nBut in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.\n\nSo:\n\n1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight\n2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess\n3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess\n4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)\n5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy\n6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.\n7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess\n8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.\n\nWait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nThen she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.\n\nThen she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nShe also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.\n\nWait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.\n\nSo I'll list all these actions in order:\n\n1. heal\n2. kidnap\n3. tie_up\n4. attack (enemy charges)\n5. search\n6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)\n7. liberate\n8. kiss\n9. recognize_tattoo\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nWait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.\n\nAlternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.\n\nSo maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.\n\nBut the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?\n\nMaybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.\n\nSo including that as an action.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)\n2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)\n3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)\n4. attack (enemy charges at her)\n5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)\n6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)\n7. liberate (frees Princess)\n8. kiss\n9. realize_identity\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nNow, mapping each to JSON:\n\nEach action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nHeal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight\n\nKidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nTie_up: same subjects\n\nAttack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nSearch: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)\n\nAttack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy\n\nLiberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess\n\nKiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.\n\nRealize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)\n\nKill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar\n\nKill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1\n\nI think that's all.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story analysis. The user has provided a JSON structure that includes actions with subjects and objects, and now they want to add preconditions based on emotional links.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. For each action, I need to identify if there are any emotional links (either non-romantic or romantic) that must exist between the subject and object for that action to make sense. These emotional links have a magnitude from -3 to 3. \n\nI'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Why would she heal him? likely because she cares about him, which is a non-romantic link with a positive magnitude, maybe +2 (concern or care).\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - The enemy's action implies negative feelings towards the Princess, probably non-romantic hatred, so magnitude -3.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Similar to kidnap, it's about the enemy's negative emotions towards her, so another non-romantic link with magnitude -3.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Enemy attacks Princess.\n   - Again, the enemy's negative feelings drive this action, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy.\n   - He is motivated by a positive emotional link towards Princess, wanting to rescue her. So non-romantic from him to her, maybe +2 (determination).\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar attacks the Enemy.\n   - His motivation is to save Princess, so non-romantic towards her with magnitude +3 (strong determination).\n\n7. **Liberate**: Jaguar frees Princess.\n   - His action stems from strong positive feelings towards her, non-romantic, magnitude +3.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight.\n   - This is a romantic link between them, so type romantic with magnitude +3 (love).\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Princess realizes Jaguar's identity via tattoo.\n   - This leads to negative emotions towards him, non-romantic with magnitude -2 (resentment or betrayal).\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Princess kills Jaguar_Knight.\n    - Driven by negative emotions due to his past actions, non-romantic with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess kills herself.\n    - This is a self-directed action, but the emotional link here would be towards herself, perhaps indicating despair or guilt, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\nNow, for each action in the JSON, I'll add the preconditions section with these inferred emotional links. If an action doesn't have a clear emotional precondition, the array will be empty. However, based on the story, most actions are driven by emotional motivations.\n\nI need to ensure that each emotional link specifies type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b', where 'a' is subject and 'b' is object). If the action involves only one character, like 'kill' towards self, then both from and to would be 'a'.\n\nLet me structure this for each action in the JSON provided.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with preconditions added based on inferred emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON now includes preconditions for each action, detailing the necessary emotional links and their magnitudes that drive the characters' actions in the story.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

The user wants me to identify or infer the necessary tensions that must exist for a character to perform an action. These tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what each tension means:\n- `character_dead`: A character has died.\n- `life_at_risk`: A character's life is in danger.\n- `health_at_risk`: A character's health is compromised.\n- `prisoner`: A character is being held captive.\n\nI need to go through each action and determine if any of these tensions are preconditions for that action. For example, if a character heals another, it might be because the recipient's health was at risk.\n\nLet me process each action:\n\n1. **Heal (Princess heals Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - Jaguar_Knight was injured from the bridge collapse. So, his health was at risk.\n   - Tension: `health_at_risk` from Jaguar_Knight to himself, since he's the one injured.\n\n2. **Kidnap (Enemy kidnaps Princess)**:\n   - Kidnapping puts her life at risk and makes her a prisoner.\n   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`, both affecting Princess.\n\n3. **Tie_up (Enemy ties Princess)**:\n   - This action continues her being a prisoner and her life remains at risk.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges at Princess)**:\n   - Directly threatens her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n\n5. **Search (Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy)**:\n   - He's searching because the enemy has taken Princess, so preconditions include her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar_Knight attacks Enemy)**:\n   - His motivation is to save Princess from danger, so `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`.\n\n7. **Liberate (Jaguar frees Princess)**:\n   - This action aims to relieve the tensions of her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n8. **Kiss (Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - No direct tension here; it's an emotional link, so no tensions as preconditions.\n\n9. **Realize_identity (Princess realizes tattoo)**:\n   - This leads to tension within Princess but doesn't directly tie to the predefined tension types.\n\n10. **Kill (Princess kills Jaguar_Knight)**:\n    - Results in his death, so `character_dead`.\n\n11. **Kill (Princess kills herself)**:\n    - She dies, so `character_dead` applied to herself.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll add the tensions as preconditions. If there are no applicable tensions, the array remains empty.\n\nI need to structure this correctly in JSON, ensuring that each tension specifies type, from, and to, using 'a' for subject and 'b' for object.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with tension preconditions added:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\":

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user by adding postconditions to each action in their JSON. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links and tensions resulting from the action. For each action, I'll identify how it affects the relationships (emotional_links) and the state of tensions.

First, let me go through each action:

1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.
   - Positive effect: Jaguar_Knight's health improves, so his emotional link towards Princess becomes more positive.
   - Tensions resolved: His health is no longer at risk.

2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.
   - Negative impact on Princess, creating a negative emotional link towards the enemy.
   - Tensions created: She is now a prisoner and her life is at risk.

3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.
   - Strengthens negative feelings towards the enemy.
   - Continues her being a prisoner and life at risk.

4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Direct threat to Princess's life, increasing negative emotional link towards the enemy and heightening tensions.

5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searching shows his determination, creating a positive emotional link from him to Princess, hoping to rescue her.

6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar fights to save Princess, which can create mutual positive emotional links if successful, but also risks his life.

7. **Liberate**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, enhancing positive emotional links between them.

8. **Kiss**: Romantic gesture, deepening romantic emotional links.

9. **Realize_identity**: Negative discovery, leading to resentment towards Jaguar_Knight.

10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Results in his death, causing grief or guilt for Princess.

11. **Kill (self)**: Princess's death concludes the story tragically.

For each action, I'll specify how emotional links and tensions change as postconditions.

time=2025-04-16T13:43:46.345-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.\n\nSo, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.\n\nI need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.\n2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.\n4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.\n5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.\n6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.\n7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.\n8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.\n9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.\n10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.\n\nNow, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)\n- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)\n- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)\n- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)\nWait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\nBut according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each event and assign the correct action:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.\nWait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.\n\nWait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.\n\nBut looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.\n\nMoving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.\n\nThen enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\n\nEnemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.\n\nEnemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)\n- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip\n- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)\n- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'\n- Ties her up: 'tie_up'\n- Charges against: 'attack'\n- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.\n- Searches for enemy: 'search'\n- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.\n\nAfter defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'\n\nThey kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)\n\nPrincess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'\n\nShe kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.\n\nWait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n1. heal (n=2)\n2. kidnap (n=2)\n3. tie_up (n=2)\n4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)\n5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.\nWait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.\n\nBut in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.\n\nSo:\n\n1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight\n2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess\n3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess\n4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)\n5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy\n6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.\n7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess\n8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.\n\nWait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nThen she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.\n\nThen she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nShe also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.\n\nWait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.\n\nSo I'll list all these actions in order:\n\n1. heal\n2. kidnap\n3. tie_up\n4. attack (enemy charges)\n5. search\n6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)\n7. liberate\n8. kiss\n9. recognize_tattoo\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nWait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.\n\nAlternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.\n\nSo maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.\n\nBut the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?\n\nMaybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.\n\nSo including that as an action.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)\n2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)\n3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)\n4. attack (enemy charges at her)\n5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)\n6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)\n7. liberate (frees Princess)\n8. kiss\n9. realize_identity\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nNow, mapping each to JSON:\n\nEach action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nHeal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight\n\nKidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nTie_up: same subjects\n\nAttack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nSearch: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)\n\nAttack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy\n\nLiberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess\n\nKiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.\n\nRealize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)\n\nKill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar\n\nKill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured JSON output based on the provided story:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions in the narrative, focusing on interactions between characters.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4.

The user has provided a JSON structure that includes actions with subjects and objects, and now they want to add preconditions based on emotional links.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. For each action, I need to identify if there are any emotional links (either non-romantic or romantic) that must exist between the subject and object for that action to make sense. These emotional links have a magnitude from -3 to 3. \n\nI'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Why would she heal him? likely because she cares about him, which is a non-romantic link with a positive magnitude, maybe +2 (concern or care).\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - The enemy's action implies negative feelings towards the Princess, probably non-romantic hatred, so magnitude -3.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Similar to kidnap, it's about the enemy's negative emotions towards her, so another non-romantic link with magnitude -3.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Enemy attacks Princess.\n   - Again, the enemy's negative feelings drive this action, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy.\n   - He is motivated by a positive emotional link towards Princess, wanting to rescue her. So non-romantic from him to her, maybe +2 (determination).\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar attacks the Enemy.\n   - His motivation is to save Princess, so non-romantic towards her with magnitude +3 (strong determination).\n\n7. **Liberate**: Jaguar frees Princess.\n   - His action stems from strong positive feelings towards her, non-romantic, magnitude +3.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight.\n   - This is a romantic link between them, so type romantic with magnitude +3 (love).\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Princess realizes Jaguar's identity via tattoo.\n   - This leads to negative emotions towards him, non-romantic with magnitude -2 (resentment or betrayal).\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Princess kills Jaguar_Knight.\n    - Driven by negative emotions due to his past actions, non-romantic with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess kills herself.\n    - This is a self-directed action, but the emotional link here would be towards herself, perhaps indicating despair or guilt, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\nNow, for each action in the JSON, I'll add the preconditions section with these inferred emotional links. If an action doesn't have a clear emotional precondition, the array will be empty. However, based on the story, most actions are driven by emotional motivations.\n\nI need to ensure that each emotional link specifies type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b', where 'a' is subject and 'b' is object). If the action involves only one character, like 'kill' towards self, then both from and to would be 'a'.\n\nLet me structure this for each action in the JSON provided.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with preconditions added based on inferred emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON now includes preconditions for each action, detailing the necessary emotional links and their magnitudes that drive the characters' actions in the story.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

The user wants me to identify or infer the necessary tensions that must exist for a character to perform an action. These tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what each tension means:\n- `character_dead`: A character has died.\n- `life_at_risk`: A character's life is in danger.\n- `health_at_risk`: A character's health is compromised.\n- `prisoner`: A character is being held captive.\n\nI need to go through each action and determine if any of these tensions are preconditions for that action. For example, if a character heals another, it might be because the recipient's health was at risk.\n\nLet me process each action:\n\n1. **Heal (Princess heals Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - Jaguar_Knight was injured from the bridge collapse. So, his health was at risk.\n   - Tension: `health_at_risk` from Jaguar_Knight to himself, since he's the one injured.\n\n2. **Kidnap (Enemy kidnaps Princess)**:\n   - Kidnapping puts her life at risk and makes her a prisoner.\n   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`, both affecting Princess.\n\n3. **Tie_up (Enemy ties Princess)**:\n   - This action continues her being a prisoner and her life remains at risk.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges at Princess)**:\n   - Directly threatens her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n\n5. **Search (Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy)**:\n   - He's searching because the enemy has taken Princess, so preconditions include her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar_Knight attacks Enemy)**:\n   - His motivation is to save Princess from danger, so `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`.\n\n7. **Liberate (Jaguar frees Princess)**:\n   - This action aims to relieve the tensions of her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n8. **Kiss (Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - No direct tension here; it's an emotional link, so no tensions as preconditions.\n\n9. **Realize_identity (Princess realizes tattoo)**:\n   - This leads to tension within Princess but doesn't directly tie to the predefined tension types.\n\n10. **Kill (Princess kills Jaguar_Knight)**:\n    - Results in his death, so `character_dead`.\n\n11. **Kill (Princess kills herself)**:\n    - She dies, so `character_dead` applied to herself.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll add the tensions as preconditions. If there are no applicable tensions, the array remains empty.\n\nI need to structure this correctly in JSON, ensuring that each tension specifies type, from, and to, using 'a' for subject and 'b' for object.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with tension preconditions added:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\":

risks.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by adding postconditions to each action in their JSON. Postconditions involve changes to emotional links and tensions resulting from the action. For each action, I'll identify how it affects the relationships (emotional_links) and the state of tensions.\n\nFirst, let me go through each action:\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Positive effect: Jaguar_Knight's health improves, so his emotional link towards Princess becomes more positive.\n   - Tensions resolved: His health is no longer at risk.\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - Negative impact on Princess, creating a negative emotional link towards the enemy.\n   - Tensions created: She is now a prisoner and her life is at risk.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Strengthens negative feelings towards the enemy.\n   - Continues her being a prisoner and life at risk.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Direct threat to Princess's life, increasing negative emotional link towards the enemy and heightening tensions.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searching shows his determination, creating a positive emotional link from him to Princess, hoping to rescue her.\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar fights to save Princess, which can create mutual positive emotional links if successful, but also risks his life.\n\n7. **Liberate**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, enhancing positive emotional links between them.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Romantic gesture, deepening romantic emotional links.\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Negative discovery, leading to resentment towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Results in his death, causing grief or guilt for Princess.\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess's death concludes the story tragically.\n\nFor each action, I'll specify how emotional links and tensions change as postconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with postconditions

links and tensions. Each action's effects are clearly outlined, providing a comprehensive view of how the narrative evolves based on character interactions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Ensure logical consistency for each action. Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nEach tension must have `from` and `to` keys. `from` refers to the character causing the tension and `to` refers to the character receiving the tension.\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to help the user by ensuring their JSON is logically consistent and free from errors. They've provided a JSON that includes actions with preconditions and postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. My task is to verify each part for consistency, correctness, and adherence to the specified rules.

First, I'll go through each action in the JSON:

1. **Heal**:
   - `n_characters` is 2, which matches having both subject (Princess) and object (Jaguar_Knight).
   - Preconditions have an emotional link from 'a' to 'b', and a tension from 'b' to 'b'.
   - Postconditions correctly resolve the health tension and update the emotional link.

2. **Kidnap**:
   - Both preconditions and postconditions have appropriate emotional links and tensions.
   - No issues with `n_characters` or key usage.

3. **Tie_up**:
   - Similar to kidnap, all references are correct.
   - Emotional links and tensions are appropriately updated.

4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**:
   - Correctly updates Princess's emotional link towards the enemy.
   - Tensions are accurately reflected.

5. **Search**:
   - Emotional links from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy are correctly set.
   - Postconditions update his determination.

6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**:
   - Preconditions and postconditions align with the action's intent.
   - No logical inconsistencies.

7. **Liberate**:
   - Resolves tensions as expected.
   - Emotional links show increased admiration.

8. **Kiss**:
   - Romantic link is correctly updated.
   - No issues with `n_characters` or keys.

9. **Realize_identity**:
   - Updates Princess's feelings towards Jaguar_Knight negatively.
   - No inconsistencies in tension handling.

10. **Kill (Jaguar)**:
    - Correctly results in his death and updates emotional links.

11. **Kill (self)**:
    - Princess's death is correctly handled, with no postconditions beyond her death.

I'll ensure that all keys are present, values are valid, and there are no illogical situations or same pre/post conditions.

time=2025-04-16T13:45:11.605-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze a story and extract specific actions related to emotional links and tensions. Let me read through their query carefully.\n\nSo, they want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on two types of emotional links: non-romantic and romantic. Also, four tension types—character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner. My task is to go through the given story, identify key actions that fit these categories, and structure them in JSON.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the story step by step. The story involves Jaguar_Knight, Princess, and several gods. There are a few main events: the storm causing injury, healing, kidnapping, rescue, romantic feelings, conflict due to a tattoo, and tragic ending with deaths.\n\nI need to extract actions that relate to emotional links or build tension. Emotional links can be non-romantic (like loyalty, friendship) or romantic (love). Tensions are specific events like someone dying, life at risk, health issues, or being a prisoner.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. TLALOC sends a storm causing bridge collapse and injury to Jaguar_Knight—this is health_at_risk tension.\n2. Princess heals Jaguar_Knight, showing non-romantic emotional link (care).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess, so she's a prisoner. Tension type: prisoner.\n4. Enemy plans to kill her at midnight—life_at_risk.\n5. Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom and bravery—preparing for rescue, maybe building tension as he's about to face danger.\n6. Enemy charges at Princess, but she's angry—this is another life_at_risk moment since the enemy is attacking.\n7. Jaguar_Knight searches and finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation with attack actions. These are tensions too.\n8. After defeating the enemy, Jaguar_Knight frees Princess, showing non-romantic (admiration) link turning into romantic feelings when they kiss.\n9. Princess recognizes the tattoo, leading to conflict—mixed emotions here, both love and hatred, so emotional links shift from romantic to negative.\n10. She kills him and herself, resulting in their deaths—character_dead tension.\n\nNow, I need to map these events into actions with subjects, objects, and n_characters. Each action should be simple and in snake_case.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Storm causes injury: 'injure' by storm (n=1)\n- Princess heals Jaguar_Knight: 'heal' (n=2)\n- Kidnap: 'kidnap' (n=2)\n- Enemy threatens to kill: 'life_at_risk' (n=1, since enemy is the subject here)\nWait, but in JSON, each action should have a subject and object as characters. So maybe 'threaten' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\nBut according to the user's example, actions are like 'eats_porridge', so I need to capture the action, not the tension type directly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to focus on actions that cause these tensions rather than labeling them. So, enemy kidnapping is an action (kidnap), which leads to prisoner tension.\n\nI'll go through each event and assign the correct action:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse and injury: This is a significant event but maybe not directly an action between characters. However, it leads to Jaguar_Knight being injured, so perhaps 'injure' by storm? Or since storm is a god's action, maybe it's better to consider TLALOC as subject.\nWait, the user said to focus on actions where subject and object are characters, not inanimate objects or gods. So maybe this event doesn't count because the subject is a god.\n\nWait, no—the bridge collapse was caused by the storm (TLALOC), but the action of injuring is done by the bridge's collapse. However, the user wants actions where both subject and object are characters. So perhaps this event isn't directly an action between two characters, so maybe we skip it or find another way.\n\nBut looking back, Jaguar_Knight was trying to cross when the bridge collapsed. So maybe 'collapse_bridge' with subject as bridge (but that's an object). Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should not include this since the subject isn't a character but a natural event caused by a god.\n\nMoving on: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight—this is a clear action between two characters.\n\nThen enemy kidnaps Princess—action 'kidnap' with enemy as subject and Princess as object.\n\nEnemy ties her up, so that's another action 'tie_up'.\n\nEnemy threatens to kill her at midnight: maybe 'threaten', but since it's a planned action, perhaps 'plan_execution'? Or just 'attack' when the time comes. Wait, in the story, after tying up, enemy charges against Princess, which is an attack.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n- Jaguar_Knight tries to cross bridge (maybe not included as subject isn't character)\n- Bridge collapses, injuring him—maybe skip\n- Princess heals: 'heal' (subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight)\n- Enemy kidnaps: 'kidnap'\n- Ties her up: 'tie_up'\n- Charges against: 'attack'\n- Jaguar_Knight prays: maybe not an action with another character, so skip.\n- Searches for enemy: 'search'\n- Attacks enemy: 'attack', throws dust, stabs, etc.—maybe break into separate actions or combine as one attack.\n\nAfter defeating enemy, frees Princess: 'liberate'\n\nThey kiss: 'kiss' (romantic link)\n\nPrincess recognizes tattoo: 'recognize_tattoo'\n\nShe kills him and herself: 'kill' twice—first Jaguar_Knight, then self.\n\nWait, but in the story, she cuts his jugular, then her own throat. So two separate actions.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n1. heal (n=2)\n2. kidnap (n=2)\n3. tie_up (n=2)\n4. attack (enemy charges) (n=2)\n5. search (Jaguar looking for enemy) but this is solo, so n=1? Or maybe 'search' without object.\nWait, the user said to only include actions where subject and object are characters. So if Jaguar_Knight searches for enemy, subject is him, object is enemy—so that's okay.\n\nBut in JSON, each action needs subject and object as characters or '-'.\n\nSo:\n\n1. heal: subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight\n2. kidnap: enemy kidnaps Princess\n3. tie_up: enemy ties Princess\n4. attack: enemy attacks Princess (when charging)\n5. search: Jaguar searches for enemy\n6. attack: Jaguar attacks enemy with dagger, etc.\n7. liberate: Jaguar frees Princess\n8. kiss: both do it, so mutual? Or subject and object as each other.\n\nWait, in the story, Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight after liberation. So 'kiss' would be subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nThen she recognizes tattoo—action 'recognize', subject Princess, maybe object is Jaguar_Knight because his tattoo is recognized.\n\nThen she kills him: action 'kill', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\nShe also kills herself: action 'kill', subject and object as herself. So n_characters=1.\n\nWait, but the user said if same character is subject and object, it's allowed with n_characters accordingly.\n\nSo I'll list all these actions in order:\n\n1. heal\n2. kidnap\n3. tie_up\n4. attack (enemy charges)\n5. search\n6. attack (Jaguar attacks enemy)\n7. liberate\n8. kiss\n9. recognize_tattoo\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nWait, but 'recognize' isn't an action that directly affects another character—maybe it's more of an internal realization, so perhaps not included.\n\nAlternatively, the action is 'express_recognition' or similar. But the user's example had actions like 'eats_porridge', which are physical.\n\nSo maybe only include actions where characters interact. So recognizing a tattoo might be considered, but as it's more internal, perhaps not.\n\nBut the user said to focus on actions that relate to emotional links and tensions. Recognizing the tattoo affects their emotional link, so perhaps it should be included. How?\n\nMaybe 'realize_identity'—so action is 'realize', subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight because she realizes his identity via the tattoo.\n\nSo including that as an action.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. heal (Princess helps Jaguar)\n2. kidnap (enemy takes Princess)\n3. tie_up (enemy restrains her)\n4. attack (enemy charges at her)\n5. search (Jaguar looks for enemy)\n6. attack (Jaguar fights enemy)\n7. liberate (frees Princess)\n8. kiss\n9. realize_identity\n10. kill (Princess kills Jaguar)\n11. kill (Princess kills herself)\n\nNow, mapping each to JSON:\n\nEach action needs action name, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nHeal: action 'heal', n=2, sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar_Knight\n\nKidnap: 'kidnap', n=2, sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nTie_up: same subjects\n\nAttack (enemy charges): 'attack', sub=Enemy, obj=Princess\n\nSearch: 'search', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy (since he's searching for enemy)\n\nAttack (Jaguar vs Enemy): 'attack', sub=Jaguar, obj=Enemy\n\nLiberate: 'liberate', sub=Jaguar, obj=Princess\n\nKiss: mutual? Or one-way. Since Princess kisses Jaguar, it's sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar.\n\nRealize_identity: sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar (she realizes his identity)\n\nKill (Jaguar): sub=Princess, obj=Jaguar\n\nKill (self): sub=Princess, obj=Princess, n=1\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured JSON output based on the provided story:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the essential actions related to emotional links and tensions in the narrative, focusing on interactions between characters.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user enhance their JSON by adding preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story analysis. The user has provided a JSON structure that includes actions with subjects and objects, and now they want to add preconditions based on emotional links.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. For each action, I need to identify if there are any emotional links (either non-romantic or romantic) that must exist between the subject and object for that action to make sense. These emotional links have a magnitude from -3 to 3. \n\nI'll go through each action one by one.\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Why would she heal him? likely because she cares about him, which is a non-romantic link with a positive magnitude, maybe +2 (concern or care).\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - The enemy's action implies negative feelings towards the Princess, probably non-romantic hatred, so magnitude -3.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Similar to kidnap, it's about the enemy's negative emotions towards her, so another non-romantic link with magnitude -3.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Enemy attacks Princess.\n   - Again, the enemy's negative feelings drive this action, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy.\n   - He is motivated by a positive emotional link towards Princess, wanting to rescue her. So non-romantic from him to her, maybe +2 (determination).\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar attacks the Enemy.\n   - His motivation is to save Princess, so non-romantic towards her with magnitude +3 (strong determination).\n\n7. **Liberate**: Jaguar frees Princess.\n   - His action stems from strong positive feelings towards her, non-romantic, magnitude +3.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight.\n   - This is a romantic link between them, so type romantic with magnitude +3 (love).\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Princess realizes Jaguar's identity via tattoo.\n   - This leads to negative emotions towards him, non-romantic with magnitude -2 (resentment or betrayal).\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Princess kills Jaguar_Knight.\n    - Driven by negative emotions due to his past actions, non-romantic with magnitude -3 (hatred).\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess kills herself.\n    - This is a self-directed action, but the emotional link here would be towards herself, perhaps indicating despair or guilt, so non-romantic with magnitude -3.\n\nNow, for each action in the JSON, I'll add the preconditions section with these inferred emotional links. If an action doesn't have a clear emotional precondition, the array will be empty. However, based on the story, most actions are driven by emotional motivations.\n\nI need to ensure that each emotional link specifies type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b', where 'a' is subject and 'b' is object). If the action involves only one character, like 'kill' towards self, then both from and to would be 'a'.\n\nLet me structure this for each action in the JSON provided.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with preconditions added based on inferred emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnap\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_up\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"realize_identity\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kill\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON now includes preconditions for each action, detailing the necessary emotional links and their magnitudes that drive the characters' actions in the story.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

The user wants me to identify or infer the necessary tensions that must exist for a character to perform an action. These tensions can be of types like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, or `prisoner`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what each tension means:\n- `character_dead`: A character has died.\n- `life_at_risk`: A character's life is in danger.\n- `health_at_risk`: A character's health is compromised.\n- `prisoner`: A character is being held captive.\n\nI need to go through each action and determine if any of these tensions are preconditions for that action. For example, if a character heals another, it might be because the recipient's health was at risk.\n\nLet me process each action:\n\n1. **Heal (Princess heals Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - Jaguar_Knight was injured from the bridge collapse. So, his health was at risk.\n   - Tension: `health_at_risk` from Jaguar_Knight to himself, since he's the one injured.\n\n2. **Kidnap (Enemy kidnaps Princess)**:\n   - Kidnapping puts her life at risk and makes her a prisoner.\n   - Tensions: `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`, both affecting Princess.\n\n3. **Tie_up (Enemy ties Princess)**:\n   - This action continues her being a prisoner and her life remains at risk.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges at Princess)**:\n   - Directly threatens her life, so `life_at_risk`.\n\n5. **Search (Jaguar_Knight searches for Enemy)**:\n   - He's searching because the enemy has taken Princess, so preconditions include her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar_Knight attacks Enemy)**:\n   - His motivation is to save Princess from danger, so `life_at_risk` and `prisoner`.\n\n7. **Liberate (Jaguar frees Princess)**:\n   - This action aims to relieve the tensions of her being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n\n8. **Kiss (Princess kisses Jaguar_Knight)**:\n   - No direct tension here; it's an emotional link, so no tensions as preconditions.\n\n9. **Realize_identity (Princess realizes tattoo)**:\n   - This leads to tension within Princess but doesn't directly tie to the predefined tension types.\n\n10. **Kill (Princess kills Jaguar_Knight)**:\n    - Results in his death, so `character_dead`.\n\n11. **Kill (Princess kills herself)**:\n    - She dies, so `character_dead` applied to herself.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll add the tensions as preconditions. If there are no applicable tensions, the array remains empty.\n\nI need to structure this correctly in JSON, ensuring that each tension specifies type, from, and to, using 'a' for subject and 'b' for object.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with tension preconditions added:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"heal\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\":

risks.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change.

Postconditions involve changes to emotional links and tensions resulting from the action. For each action, I'll identify how it affects the relationships (emotional_links) and the state of tensions.\n\nFirst, let me go through each action:\n\n1. **Heal**: Princess heals Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Positive effect: Jaguar_Knight's health improves, so his emotional link towards Princess becomes more positive.\n   - Tensions resolved: His health is no longer at risk.\n\n2. **Kidnap**: Enemy kidnaps Princess.\n   - Negative impact on Princess, creating a negative emotional link towards the enemy.\n   - Tensions created: She is now a prisoner and her life is at risk.\n\n3. **Tie_up**: Enemy ties up Princess.\n   - Strengthens negative feelings towards the enemy.\n   - Continues her being a prisoner and life at risk.\n\n4. **Attack (Enemy charges)**: Direct threat to Princess's life, increasing negative emotional link towards the enemy and heightening tensions.\n\n5. **Search**: Jaguar_Knight searching shows his determination, creating a positive emotional link from him to Princess, hoping to rescue her.\n\n6. **Attack (Jaguar vs Enemy)**: Jaguar fights to save Princess, which can create mutual positive emotional links if successful, but also risks his life.\n\n7. **Liberate**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, enhancing positive emotional links between them.\n\n8. **Kiss**: Romantic gesture, deepening romantic emotional links.\n\n9. **Realize_identity**: Negative discovery, leading to resentment towards Jaguar_Knight.\n\n10. **Kill (Jaguar)**: Results in his death, causing grief or guilt for Princess.\n\n11. **Kill (self)**: Princess's death concludes the story tragically.\n\nFor each action, I'll specify how emotional links and tensions change as postconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere's the enhanced JSON with postconditions

Each action's effects are clearly outlined, providing a comprehensive view of how the narrative evolves based on character interactions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Ensure logical consistency for each action. Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nEach tension must have `from` and `to` keys. `from` refers to the character causing the tension and `to` refers to the character receiving the tension.\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by ensuring their JSON is logically consistent and free from errors.

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user by ensuring that each action in their JSON has appropriate postconditions. The user pointed out that the 'kill' actions didn't have postconditions, so I'll address this.

First, for the 'kill' actions:

1. **Kill (Jaguar_Knight)**:
   - After killing him, Princess likely feels guilt or grief.
   - Emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight becomes more negative.
   - Tensions: His death is confirmed.

2. **Kill (self)**:
   - Princess's death concludes her emotional journey.
   - No further tensions as she's deceased.

I'll update these actions with relevant postconditions, ensuring they're logical and distinct from preconditions.
