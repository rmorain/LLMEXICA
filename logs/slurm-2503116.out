Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the sky looks blue. Hmm, I remember hearing this as a kid, but now I want to really understand it from a scientific perspective. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

First off, when we look at the sky on a clear day, it's usually a bright blue color. But sometimes, especially during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns into different colors like orange or red. So, why is that blue?

I think it has something to do with the atmosphere and how light travels through it. I remember learning about refraction in school, which is when light bends as it passes through a medium. Maybe that plays a role here.

Wait, but if the sky is blue during the day and changes color at sunrise or sunset, there must be more to it than just regular sunlight. So perhaps the Earth's atmosphere interacts with the Sun's light in some way.

I've heard about something called Rayleigh scattering. I think that has to do with how shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more by particles in the air. But what's a wavelength? Oh, right, different colors of light have different wavelengths. Blue and violet have shorter wavelengths compared to red and orange.

So maybe when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it gets broken down into its component colors based on their wavelengths. The blue light scatters off molecules in the air more than other colors because of this shorter wavelength thing.

But wait, if blue is scattered so much, why isn't the sky violet then? I've always heard that violet is a color we can't see well or at all sometimes. Is it because our eyes are more sensitive to blue?

Also, during sunrise and sunset, the sky turns into red or orange. That must be different scattering, maybe something called Rayleigh scattering in those specific times when the Sun is lower on the horizon.

I think when the Sun is near the horizon, its light has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere. So it has to travel a longer path through clouds and air particles. If blue scatters more at shorter distances, then maybe the other colors can reach our eyes better from further away, giving us those warm colors like red or orange.

But why does the sky only turn red during sunrise and sunset? Is it because we are looking through more atmosphere when the Sun is low, so the scattered blue light is blocked by the horizon itself?

Wait, but the question was about why the sky is blue. So focusing back on that, the primary reason is Rayleigh scattering where shorter wavelengths like blue get scattered more. Our eyes are most sensitive to green and blue, so we perceive the sky as blue when it's clear.

So putting it all together: when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles. Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter in all directions much more than longer wavelengths (red). This scattering makes the sky appear blue because those shorter wavelengths reach our eyes from various parts of the atmosphere. When we look at the horizon during sunrise or sunset, the Sun's light has to pass through more atmosphere, which scatters other colors like red and orange instead.

I think I've got a basic understanding now, but I'm still a bit fuzzy on some details, like why our eyes are more sensitive to blue than green. Maybe it's because of how cones in our eyes work? I recall something about having three types of color receptors with different sensitivities. Blue is at the peak sensitivity for one type.

Also, during the day when there isn't as much atmosphere blocking light, blue gets scattered all around so we see it more prominently. At night, without sunlight, the sky doesn't show this effect because there's no white light to scatter off of particles in the air.

So yeah, I think that's about it. The key factors are Rayleigh scattering and our eyes' sensitivity to certain wavelengths.

The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles. Sunlight is composed of various colors, each corresponding to different wavelengths‚Äîblue light has a shorter wavelength compared to red or orange.

Rayleigh scattering causes shorter wavelengths (like blue) to scatter off atmospheric particles more effectively than longer wavelengths (such as red). This scattering distributes the scattered blue light in all directions, making it visible from any point on Earth. Additionally, our eyes are most sensitive to blue and green light due to the presence of cone cells that peak sensitivity around these colors.

During sunrise or sunset, the Sun is near the horizon, so its light passes through more atmosphere, scattering other wavelengths like red and orange instead of blue. This explains why the sky turns those colors at those times.

In summary, the sky appears blue because Rayleigh scattering scatters shorter blue wavelengths more than longer wavelengths during the day, while our eyes are most sensitive to these blue-green hues. At sunrise or sunset, the Sun's light passes through more atmosphere, leading to different colors like red and orange.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the sky looks blue. Hmm, I remember hearing this as a kid, but now I want to really understand it from a scientific perspective. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

First off, when we look at the sky on a clear day, it's usually a bright blue color. But sometimes, especially during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns into different colors like orange or red. So, why is that blue?

I think it has something to do with the atmosphere and how light travels through it. I remember learning about refraction in school, which is when light bends as it passes through a medium. Maybe that plays a role here.

Wait, but if the sky is blue during the day and changes color at sunrise or sunset, there must be more to it than just regular sunlight. So perhaps the Earth's atmosphere interacts with the Sun's light in some way.

I've heard about something called Rayleigh scattering. I think that has to do with how shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more by particles in the air. But what's a wavelength? Oh, right, different colors of light have different wavelengths. Blue and violet have shorter wavelengths compared to red and orange.
