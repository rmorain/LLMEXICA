Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First off, from what I remember, the sun typically rises in the east and sets in the west. That's what I've observed every day. But wait, maybe that's not always the case? I should consider some astronomical facts here.

So, Earth rotates from west to east, which is why the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west. But are there any exceptions or special cases where the sun could rise in the west instead? Maybe near the poles? I think I've heard something about the midnight sun phenomenon. In places like northern Norway or Alaska, during certain times of the year, the sun can stay visible all day. So does that mean it rises in a different direction?

Wait, no, even at the poles, the sun's movement is circular. It doesn't really rise and set in the traditional sense; instead, it moves in a circle in the sky. So during summer months near the Arctic Circle, the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours, but when it does "set" or "rise," it's more about moving in that circular path rather than rising from the west.

Another thought: could there be a situation where the Earth's rotation changes direction? That seems highly unlikely. The Earth's rotation is what causes day and night, and any change in its rotational axis would have catastrophic effects. I don't think that happens naturally; maybe only in some hypothetical scenarios or sci-fi stories.

Also, considering Earth's axial tilt. The tilt affects the seasons but doesn't make the sun rise in the west. It just changes how high the sun is in the sky at different times of the year. So during winter near the poles, the sun might be lower on the horizon, but it still rises in the east.

I've heard about the Islamic belief that in the end times, the sun will rise in the west. That's more of a religious eschatology thing rather than an astronomical event. So that's probably not something we need to consider here.

Wait, what about during a solar eclipse? Does that affect where the sun appears to rise or set? I don't think so; it just makes the sun look different for a while. The direction from which it rises and sets remains the same.

So putting this all together: normally, the sun rises in the east because of Earth's rotation. There are places near the poles where the sun doesn't set below the horizon, but when it does rise or set, it's still moving from east to west relative to an observer's perspective. There aren't any natural scenarios on Earth where the sun actually rises in the west. So the answer should be no.

No.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.

The user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.

Looking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.

First, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.

Next, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.

However, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.

I need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.

So, breaking down the story:

1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).
2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).
3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).
4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.
5. He attacks and kills the enemy, liberates Princess (love starts).
6. Princess kisses him but then recognizes the tattoo (clashing emotions).
7. She kills him (character dead), then herself (another character dead).

Each of these steps should be an action in the JSON with appropriate keys filled out. Making sure that actions without a subject or object have '-' and n_characters reflects the participants.

I think I've covered all necessary points, ensuring each action relates to emotional links or tension types as specified.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5. He attacks and kills the enemy, liberates Princess (love starts).\n6. Princess kisses him but then recognizes the tattoo (clashing emotions).\n7. She kills him (character dead), then herself (another character dead).\n\nEach of these steps should be an action in the JSON with appropriate keys filled out. Making sure that actions without a subject or object have '-' and n_characters reflects the participants.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points, ensuring each action relates to emotional links or tension types as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_character_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss_character\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_jugular_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_bleed_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\nThe story begins with the string \"Sto\" and is then followed by a sequence of actions.

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help the user convert their JSON story analysis into this DPS format. First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with "Sto" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.

Looking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with "subject," "action," and "object." Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, "storm_damage_bridge" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.

Now, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.

Let's take the first few actions:

1. "storm_damage_bridge" – no subject or object, so it's just that.
2. "character_injured_head" – here, the object is "jaguar_knight," but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as "-" injured_head "jaguar_knight."

Wait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like "Was_In_Love_With" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as "- injured_head jaguar_knight."

But looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use "-" to indicate absence.

Continuing this way for each action:

- "prepare_curative_plasma" has subject "princess" and object "jaguar_knight," so it would be "princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight."
- "apply_plasma_to_wounds" similarly would be "princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight."

For actions where both subject and object are the same, like "cut_own_throat_with_dagger," it's represented as "princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess." But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.

I also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, "liberate_princess" becomes "jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess."

Going through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using "-" appropriately.

Finally, wrapping everything up with "Sto" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5. He attacks and kills the enemy, liberates Princess (love starts).\n6. Princess kisses him but then recognizes the tattoo (clashing emotions).\n7. She kills him (character dead), then herself (another character dead).\n\nEach of these steps should be an action in the JSON with appropriate keys filled out. Making sure that actions without a subject or object have '-' and n_characters reflects the participants.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points, ensuring each action relates to emotional links or tension types as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_character_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss_character\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_jugular_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_bleed_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\nThe story begins with the string \"Sto\" and is then followed by a sequence of actions.

An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character.

First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.\n\nLooking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with \"subject,\" \"action,\" and \"object.\" Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, \"storm_damage_bridge\" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.\n\nNow, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.\n\nLet's take the first few actions:\n\n1. \"storm_damage_bridge\" – no subject or object, so it's just that.\n2. \"character_injured_head\" – here, the object is \"jaguar_knight,\" but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as \"-\" injured_head \"jaguar_knight.\"\n\nWait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like \"Was_In_Love_With\" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as \"- injured_head jaguar_knight.\"\n\nBut looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use \"-\" to indicate absence.\n\nContinuing this way for each action:\n\n- \"prepare_curative_plasma\" has subject \"princess\" and object \"jaguar_knight,\" so it would be \"princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight.\"\n- \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\" similarly would be \"princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight.\"\n\nFor actions where both subject and object are the same, like \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger,\" it's represented as \"princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess.\" But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.\n\nI also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, \"liberate_princess\" becomes \"jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess.\"\n\nGoing through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using \"-\" appropriately.\n\nFinally, wrapping everything up with \"Sto\" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\n- storm_damage_bridge -\n- character_injured_head jaguar_knight\nprincess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\nprincess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\n- character_recuperate jaguar_knight\nenemy enemy_kidnap_princess princess\nenemy tie_character_to_rock princess\njaguar_knight character_pray_for_wisdom -\njaguar_knight search_for_enemy enemy\njaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\njaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\njaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\n- imitate_sacred_ceremony -\njaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nprincess kiss_character jaguar_knight\n- recognize_tattoo princess\n- invoke_god_of_the_dead -\nprincess cut_jugular_with_dagger jaguar_knight\n- character_bleed_to_death jaguar_knight\nprincess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user wants me to identify or infer these preconditions based on the actions described.

First, let's recall what an emotional link is. Emotional links can be either `friendship` (platonic) or `love` (romantic), and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. Negative magnitudes indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, while positive ones indicate affection or love.

Preconditions are the requirements that must be met for an action to make sense. For example, if character A attacks character B, there might be a precondition that character A feels hatred towards character B (negative friendship link).

Now, I'll go through each action one by one and try to infer the necessary emotional links.

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This is an event caused by Tlaloc, so no characters are involved. No preconditions needed.
   
2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight gets injured. No specific emotional link is required here; it's just an event happening to him.

3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess prepares the plasma to help Jaguar Knight. This suggests a positive friendship or love link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight, perhaps magnitude 2 (affection).

4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action would require the same positive emotional link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight.

5. **character_recuperate**: Jaguar Knight gets better. No specific precondition here; it's a result of the princess's actions.

6. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess. This implies a negative emotional link from Enemy towards Princess, maybe hatred with magnitude -3.

7. **tie_character_to_rock**: Enemy ties Princess up. Again, this action follows from the kidnapping and requires the same negative emotional link (hatred).

8. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight prays for wisdom to rescue Princess. This suggests a positive emotional link towards Princess, indicating love or strong friendship.

9. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar Knight searches for Enemy to save Princess. This again stems from his positive feelings towards Princess and a desire to protect her.

10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: These actions are driven by Jaguar Knight's anger or determination to rescue Princess, so they might require a negative emotional link towards Enemy (hatred) and a positive one towards Princess (love).

11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: This is more of a ritualistic action following the battle, so no specific emotional precondition beyond what led to the victory.

12. **liberate_princess**: Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, which requires his positive emotional link towards her.

13. **kiss_character**: Princess kisses Jaguar Knight, indicating mutual romantic feelings (love), so both should have a positive love link towards each other with high magnitude, maybe 3.

14. **recognize_tattoo**: Princess recognizes the tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar Knight but hates his actions, leading to a negative emotional link (hatred) towards him.

15. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**: Princess invokes Huitzilopochtli before killing Jaguar Knight and herself. This might stem from her conflicting emotions—love turned to hatred.

16. **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, **character_bleed_to_death**: These actions are driven by Princess's hatred towards Jaguar Knight after recognizing the tattoo, indicating a negative emotional link (magnitude -3).

17. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: Princess kills herself, which could be driven by grief or guilt related to her actions, possibly linked to her love for Jaguar Knight turned to tragedy.

In each case, I need to specify whether the precondition is about friendship or love and assign a magnitude based on the context of the story. For example, rescuing actions are driven by positive emotions (love), while attacking actions are driven by negative ones (hatred).

I'll structure this by adding a `preconditions` key to each action in the JSON, with an array of emotional links. Each link will specify the type (`friendship` or `love`), magnitude (-3 to 3), and which characters are involved (`from` and `to` as 'a' for subject and 'b' for object).

This way, each action's preconditions are clearly defined based on the inferred emotional links.

time=2025-04-09T15:02:01.162-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5.

The sequence of actions always follows the form of `subject` `action` `object` where `subject` is the character performing the action and `object` is the character receiving the action. \n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help the user convert their JSON story analysis into this DPS format. First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.\n\nLooking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with \"subject,\" \"action,\" and \"object.\" Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, \"storm_damage_bridge\" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.\n\nNow, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.\n\nLet's take the first few actions:\n\n1. \"storm_damage_bridge\" – no subject or object, so it's just that.\n2. \"character_injured_head\" – here, the object is \"jaguar_knight,\" but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as \"-\" injured_head \"jaguar_knight.\"\n\nWait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like \"Was_In_Love_With\" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as \"- injured_head jaguar_knight.\"\n\nBut looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use \"-\" to indicate absence.\n\nContinuing this way for each action:\n\n- \"prepare_curative_plasma\" has subject \"princess\" and object \"jaguar_knight,\" so it would be \"princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight.\"\n- \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\" similarly would be \"princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight.\"\n\nFor actions where both subject and object are the same, like \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger,\" it's represented as \"princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess.\" But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.\n\nI also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, \"liberate_princess\" becomes \"jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess.\"\n\nGoing through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using \"-\" appropriately.\n\nFinally, wrapping everything up with \"Sto\" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\n- storm_damage_bridge -\n- character_injured_head jaguar_knight\nprincess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\nprincess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\n- character_recuperate jaguar_knight\nenemy enemy_kidnap_princess princess\nenemy tie_character_to_rock princess\njaguar_knight character_pray_for_wisdom -\njaguar_knight search_for_enemy enemy\njaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\njaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\njaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\n- imitate_sacred_ceremony -\njaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nprincess kiss_character jaguar_knight\n- recognize_tattoo princess\n- invoke_god_of_the_dead -\nprincess cut_jugular_with_dagger jaguar_knight\n- character_bleed_to_death jaguar_knight\nprincess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user wants me to identify or infer these preconditions based on the actions described.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an emotional link is. Emotional links can be either `friendship` (platonic) or `love` (romantic), and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. Negative magnitudes indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, while positive ones indicate affection or love.\n\nPreconditions are the requirements that must be met for an action to make sense. For example, if character A attacks character B, there might be a precondition that character A feels hatred towards character B (negative friendship link).\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one and try to infer the necessary emotional links.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This is an event caused by Tlaloc, so no characters are involved. No preconditions needed.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight gets injured. No specific emotional link is required here; it's just an event happening to him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess prepares the plasma to help Jaguar Knight. This suggests a positive friendship or love link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight, perhaps magnitude 2 (affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action would require the same positive emotional link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight.\n\n5. **character_recuperate**: Jaguar Knight gets better. No specific precondition here; it's a result of the princess's actions.\n\n6. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess. This implies a negative emotional link from Enemy towards Princess, maybe hatred with magnitude -3.\n\n7. **tie_character_to_rock**: Enemy ties Princess up. Again, this action follows from the kidnapping and requires the same negative emotional link (hatred).\n\n8. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight prays for wisdom to rescue Princess. This suggests a positive emotional link towards Princess, indicating love or strong friendship.\n\n9. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar Knight searches for Enemy to save Princess. This again stems from his positive feelings towards Princess and a desire to protect her.\n\n10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: These actions are driven by Jaguar Knight's anger or determination to rescue Princess, so they might require a negative emotional link towards Enemy (hatred) and a positive one towards Princess (love).\n\n11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: This is more of a ritualistic action following the battle, so no specific emotional precondition beyond what led to the victory.\n\n12. **liberate_princess**: Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, which requires his positive emotional link towards her.\n\n13. **kiss_character**: Princess kisses Jaguar Knight, indicating mutual romantic feelings (love), so both should have a positive love link towards each other with high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n14. **recognize_tattoo**: Princess recognizes the tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar Knight but hates his actions, leading to a negative emotional link (hatred) towards him.\n\n15. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**: Princess invokes Huitzilopochtli before killing Jaguar Knight and herself. This might stem from her conflicting emotions—love turned to hatred.\n\n16. **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, **character_bleed_to_death**: These actions are driven by Princess's hatred towards Jaguar Knight after recognizing the tattoo, indicating a negative emotional link (magnitude -3).\n\n17. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: Princess kills herself, which could be driven by grief or guilt related to her actions, possibly linked to her love for Jaguar Knight turned to tragedy.\n\nIn each case, I need to specify whether the precondition is about friendship or love and assign a magnitude based on the context of the story. For example, rescuing actions are driven by positive emotions (love), while attacking actions are driven by negative ones (hatred).\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `preconditions` key to each action in the JSON, with an array of emotional links. Each link will specify the type (`friendship` or `love`), magnitude (-3 to 3), and which characters are involved (`from` and `to` as 'a' for subject and 'b' for object).\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions are clearly defined based on the inferred emotional links.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

Alright, so I need to help the user identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in their story analysis. Tensions include things like a character being dead, life at risk, health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, and love competition.

Let me start by understanding what a precondition is in this context. It's something that needs to be true for an action to make sense. For example, if Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, there might be a tension like 'prisoner' because she was tied up.

I'll go through each action one by one and think about what tensions must exist for the action to occur.

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This event sets up the story but doesn't directly involve characters, so no specific tension is required beyond the storm itself.
   
2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight's injury introduces a health risk, so this action requires a 'health_at_risk' tension for him.

3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: These actions are taken because of Jaguar Knight's injuries, maintaining the 'health_at_risk' tension.

4. **character_recuperate**: This action resolves the health risk, so no ongoing tension is needed here.

5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **tie_character_to_rock**: These introduce a 'prisoner' tension for Princess.
   
6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight's prayer is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, maintaining the 'prisoner' tension.

7. **search_for_enemy**, **attack_with_dagger**, etc.: All these actions are taken under the context of rescuing a prisoner and involve risks like 'life_at_risk'.

8. **liberate_princess**: This action resolves the 'prisoner' tension but introduces a new emotional link (love).

9. **kiss_character**: This action follows from the established love between Jaguar Knight and Princess.

10. **recognize_tattoo**: This creates clashing emotions in Princess, introducing a 'clashing_emotions' tension.

11. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**, **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, etc.: These actions are driven by the clashing emotions leading to tragic consequences like deaths.

12. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: This results from grief over Jaguar Knight's death, maintaining the 'character_dead' tension.

I need to map each action to the relevant tensions, considering both the subject ('a') and object ('b'). For example, if Princess is tied up, the tension is on her ('b'), while Jaguar Knight's prayer relates to rescuing her ('b').

I'll structure this by adding a `tensions` array within the `preconditions` of each action. Each tension will specify its type and which characters are involved as 'from' and 'to'.

This way, each action's preconditions related to tensions are clearly defined based on the story context.

time=2025-04-09T15:03:27.202-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5. He attacks and kills the enemy, liberates Princess (love starts).\n6. Princess kisses him but then recognizes the tattoo (clashing emotions).\n7. She kills him (character dead), then herself (another character dead).\n\nEach of these steps should be an action in the JSON with appropriate keys filled out. Making sure that actions without a subject or object have '-' and n_characters reflects the participants.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points, ensuring each action relates to emotional links or tension types as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_character_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss_character\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_jugular_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_bleed_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\nThe story begins with the string \"Sto\" and is then followed by a sequence of actions.

First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.\n\nLooking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with \"subject,\" \"action,\" and \"object.\" Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, \"storm_damage_bridge\" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.\n\nNow, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.\n\nLet's take the first few actions:\n\n1. \"storm_damage_bridge\" – no subject or object, so it's just that.\n2. \"character_injured_head\" – here, the object is \"jaguar_knight,\" but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as \"-\" injured_head \"jaguar_knight.\"\n\nWait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like \"Was_In_Love_With\" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as \"- injured_head jaguar_knight.\"\n\nBut looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use \"-\" to indicate absence.\n\nContinuing this way for each action:\n\n- \"prepare_curative_plasma\" has subject \"princess\" and object \"jaguar_knight,\" so it would be \"princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight.\"\n- \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\" similarly would be \"princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight.\"\n\nFor actions where both subject and object are the same, like \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger,\" it's represented as \"princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess.\" But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.\n\nI also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, \"liberate_princess\" becomes \"jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess.\"\n\nGoing through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using \"-\" appropriately.\n\nFinally, wrapping everything up with \"Sto\" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\n- storm_damage_bridge -\n- character_injured_head jaguar_knight\nprincess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\nprincess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\n- character_recuperate jaguar_knight\nenemy enemy_kidnap_princess princess\nenemy tie_character_to_rock princess\njaguar_knight character_pray_for_wisdom -\njaguar_knight search_for_enemy enemy\njaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\njaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\njaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\n- imitate_sacred_ceremony -\njaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nprincess kiss_character jaguar_knight\n- recognize_tattoo princess\n- invoke_god_of_the_dead -\nprincess cut_jugular_with_dagger jaguar_knight\n- character_bleed_to_death jaguar_knight\nprincess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user wants me to identify or infer these preconditions based on the actions described.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an emotional link is. Emotional links can be either `friendship` (platonic) or `love` (romantic), and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. Negative magnitudes indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, while positive ones indicate affection or love.\n\nPreconditions are the requirements that must be met for an action to make sense. For example, if character A attacks character B, there might be a precondition that character A feels hatred towards character B (negative friendship link).\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one and try to infer the necessary emotional links.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This is an event caused by Tlaloc, so no characters are involved. No preconditions needed.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight gets injured. No specific emotional link is required here; it's just an event happening to him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess prepares the plasma to help Jaguar Knight. This suggests a positive friendship or love link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight, perhaps magnitude 2 (affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action would require the same positive emotional link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight.\n\n5. **character_recuperate**: Jaguar Knight gets better. No specific precondition here; it's a result of the princess's actions.\n\n6. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess. This implies a negative emotional link from Enemy towards Princess, maybe hatred with magnitude -3.\n\n7. **tie_character_to_rock**: Enemy ties Princess up. Again, this action follows from the kidnapping and requires the same negative emotional link (hatred).\n\n8. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight prays for wisdom to rescue Princess. This suggests a positive emotional link towards Princess, indicating love or strong friendship.\n\n9. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar Knight searches for Enemy to save Princess. This again stems from his positive feelings towards Princess and a desire to protect her.\n\n10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: These actions are driven by Jaguar Knight's anger or determination to rescue Princess, so they might require a negative emotional link towards Enemy (hatred) and a positive one towards Princess (love).\n\n11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: This is more of a ritualistic action following the battle, so no specific emotional precondition beyond what led to the victory.\n\n12. **liberate_princess**: Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, which requires his positive emotional link towards her.\n\n13. **kiss_character**: Princess kisses Jaguar Knight, indicating mutual romantic feelings (love), so both should have a positive love link towards each other with high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n14. **recognize_tattoo**: Princess recognizes the tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar Knight but hates his actions, leading to a negative emotional link (hatred) towards him.\n\n15. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**: Princess invokes Huitzilopochtli before killing Jaguar Knight and herself. This might stem from her conflicting emotions—love turned to hatred.\n\n16. **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, **character_bleed_to_death**: These actions are driven by Princess's hatred towards Jaguar Knight after recognizing the tattoo, indicating a negative emotional link (magnitude -3).\n\n17. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: Princess kills herself, which could be driven by grief or guilt related to her actions, possibly linked to her love for Jaguar Knight turned to tragedy.\n\nIn each case, I need to specify whether the precondition is about friendship or love and assign a magnitude based on the context of the story. For example, rescuing actions are driven by positive emotions (love), while attacking actions are driven by negative ones (hatred).\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `preconditions` key to each action in the JSON, with an array of emotional links. Each link will specify the type (`friendship` or `love`), magnitude (-3 to 3), and which characters are involved (`from` and `to` as 'a' for subject and 'b' for object).\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions are clearly defined based on the inferred emotional links.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

Tensions include things like a character being dead, life at risk, health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLet me start by understanding what a precondition is in this context. It's something that needs to be true for an action to make sense. For example, if Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, there might be a tension like 'prisoner' because she was tied up.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one and think about what tensions must exist for the action to occur.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This event sets up the story but doesn't directly involve characters, so no specific tension is required beyond the storm itself.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight's injury introduces a health risk, so this action requires a 'health_at_risk' tension for him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: These actions are taken because of Jaguar Knight's injuries, maintaining the 'health_at_risk' tension.\n\n4. **character_recuperate**: This action resolves the health risk, so no ongoing tension is needed here.\n\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **tie_character_to_rock**: These introduce a 'prisoner' tension for Princess.\n   \n6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight's prayer is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, maintaining the 'prisoner' tension.\n\n7. **search_for_enemy**, **attack_with_dagger**, etc.: All these actions are taken under the context of rescuing a prisoner and involve risks like 'life_at_risk'.\n\n8. **liberate_princess**: This action resolves the 'prisoner' tension but introduces a new emotional link (love).\n\n9. **kiss_character**: This action follows from the established love between Jaguar Knight and Princess.\n\n10. **recognize_tattoo**: This creates clashing emotions in Princess, introducing a 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\n11. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**, **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, etc.: These actions are driven by the clashing emotions leading to tragic consequences like deaths.\n\n12. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: This results from grief over Jaguar Knight's death, maintaining the 'character_dead' tension.\n\nI need to map each action to the relevant tensions, considering both the subject ('a') and object ('b').

Alright, I need to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in the given story analysis. Postconditions are changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from an action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they can't be the same as preconditions if those exist.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand Emotional Links and Tensions**: Emotional links can be friendship or love, with magnitudes from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, etc.

2. **Postconditions Definition**:
   - For emotional links: If an action positively affects the object, the object develops a positive link towards the subject. If negatively affected, it's negative.
   - For tensions: Actions can resolve or introduce new tensions.

3. **Special Normal Tensions**: These include life_normal (resolves life_at_risk), health_normal (resolves health_at_risk), and prisoner_freed (resolves prisoner).

4. **Process Each Action**:
   - Start with the first action, "storm_damage_bridge". It doesn't involve characters, so no emotional links, but introduces a tension like 'health_at_risk' for Jaguar Knight.
   - For "prepare_curative_plasma" and similar actions, Princess's positive action leads to Jaguar Knight developing a positive friendship link towards her. Also, using the plasma might reduce his health risk, introducing 'health_normal'.
   - Actions like "enemy_kidnap_princess" introduce 'prisoner' tension for Princess.
   - Combat actions ("attack_with_dagger", etc.) likely increase negative emotional links and tensions like 'life_at_risk'.
   - The rescue action ("liberate_princess") resolves the 'prisoner' tension, introducing 'prisoner_freed', and strengthens their love link.
   - Recognition of the tattoo introduces 'clashing_emotions' for Princess due to conflicting feelings.
   - Tragic actions at the end introduce 'character_dead' tensions and resolve any remaining ones.

5. **Ensure Postconditions Aren't Same as Preconditions**: If an action has preconditions, ensure the postconditions are different or new.

6. **Structure JSON Accordingly**: For each action, add a `postconditions` object with `emotional_links` and `tensions` arrays, specifying changes resulting from the action.

I'll go through each action methodically, ensuring that postconditions reflect logical outcomes based on the story context.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5. He attacks and kills the enemy, liberates Princess (love starts).\n6. Princess kisses him but then recognizes the tattoo (clashing emotions).\n7. She kills him (character dead), then herself (another character dead).\n\nEach of these steps should be an action in the JSON with appropriate keys filled out. Making sure that actions without a subject or object have '-' and n_characters reflects the participants.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points, ensuring each action relates to emotional links or tension types as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured_head\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recuperate\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"tie_character_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kiss_character\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_the_dead\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_jugular_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_bleed_to_death\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\nThe story begins with the string \"Sto\" and is then followed by a sequence of actions. The sequence of actions always follows the form of `subject` `action` `object` where `subject` is the character performing the action and `object` is the character receiving the action. \n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help the user convert their JSON story analysis into this DPS format. First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.\n\nLooking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with \"subject,\" \"action,\" and \"object.\" Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, \"storm_damage_bridge\" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.\n\nNow, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.\n\nLet's take the first few actions:\n\n1. \"storm_damage_bridge\" – no subject or object, so it's just that.\n2. \"character_injured_head\" – here, the object is \"jaguar_knight,\" but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as \"-\" injured_head \"jaguar_knight.\"\n\nWait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like \"Was_In_Love_With\" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as \"- injured_head jaguar_knight.\"\n\nBut looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use \"-\" to indicate absence.\n\nContinuing this way for each action:\n\n- \"prepare_curative_plasma\" has subject \"princess\" and object \"jaguar_knight,\" so it would be \"princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight.\"\n- \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\" similarly would be \"princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight.\"\n\nFor actions where both subject and object are the same, like \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger,\" it's represented as \"princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess.\" But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.\n\nI also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, \"liberate_princess\" becomes \"jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess.\"\n\nGoing through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using \"-\" appropriately.\n\nFinally, wrapping everything up with \"Sto\" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\n- storm_damage_bridge -\n- character_injured_head jaguar_knight\nprincess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\nprincess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\n- character_recuperate jaguar_knight\nenemy enemy_kidnap_princess princess\nenemy tie_character_to_rock princess\njaguar_knight character_pray_for_wisdom -\njaguar_knight search_for_enemy enemy\njaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\njaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\njaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\n- imitate_sacred_ceremony -\njaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nprincess kiss_character jaguar_knight\n- recognize_tattoo princess\n- invoke_god_of_the_dead -\nprincess cut_jugular_with_dagger jaguar_knight\n- character_bleed_to_death jaguar_knight\nprincess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to add preconditions related to emotional links for each action in the given story analysis. The user wants me to identify or infer these preconditions based on the actions described.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an emotional link is. Emotional links can be either `friendship` (platonic) or `love` (romantic), and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. Negative magnitudes indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, while positive ones indicate affection or love.\n\nPreconditions are the requirements that must be met for an action to make sense. For example, if character A attacks character B, there might be a precondition that character A feels hatred towards character B (negative friendship link).\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one and try to infer the necessary emotional links.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This is an event caused by Tlaloc, so no characters are involved. No preconditions needed.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight gets injured. No specific emotional link is required here; it's just an event happening to him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess prepares the plasma to help Jaguar Knight. This suggests a positive friendship or love link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight, perhaps magnitude 2 (affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action would require the same positive emotional link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight.\n\n5. **character_recuperate**: Jaguar Knight gets better. No specific precondition here; it's a result of the princess's actions.\n\n6. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess. This implies a negative emotional link from Enemy towards Princess, maybe hatred with magnitude -3.\n\n7. **tie_character_to_rock**: Enemy ties Princess up. Again, this action follows from the kidnapping and requires the same negative emotional link (hatred).\n\n8. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight prays for wisdom to rescue Princess. This suggests a positive emotional link towards Princess, indicating love or strong friendship.\n\n9. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar Knight searches for Enemy to save Princess. This again stems from his positive feelings towards Princess and a desire to protect her.\n\n10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: These actions are driven by Jaguar Knight's anger or determination to rescue Princess, so they might require a negative emotional link towards Enemy (hatred) and a positive one towards Princess (love).\n\n11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: This is more of a ritualistic action following the battle, so no specific emotional precondition beyond what led to the victory.\n\n12. **liberate_princess**: Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, which requires his positive emotional link towards her.\n\n13. **kiss_character**: Princess kisses Jaguar Knight, indicating mutual romantic feelings (love), so both should have a positive love link towards each other with high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n14. **recognize_tattoo**: Princess recognizes the tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar Knight but hates his actions, leading to a negative emotional link (hatred) towards him.\n\n15. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**: Princess invokes Huitzilopochtli before killing Jaguar Knight and herself. This might stem from her conflicting emotions—love turned to hatred.\n\n16. **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, **character_bleed_to_death**: These actions are driven by Princess's hatred towards Jaguar Knight after recognizing the tattoo, indicating a negative emotional link (magnitude -3).\n\n17. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: Princess kills herself, which could be driven by grief or guilt related to her actions, possibly linked to her love for Jaguar Knight turned to tragedy.\n\nIn each case, I need to specify whether the precondition is about friendship or love and assign a magnitude based on the context of the story. For example, rescuing actions are driven by positive emotions (love), while attacking actions are driven by negative ones (hatred).\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `preconditions` key to each action in the JSON, with an array of emotional links. Each link will specify the type (`friendship` or `love`), magnitude (-3 to 3), and which characters are involved (`from` and `to` as 'a' for subject and 'b' for object).\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions are clearly defined based on the inferred emotional links.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in their story analysis. Tensions include things like a character being dead, life at risk, health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLet me start by understanding what a precondition is in this context. It's something that needs to be true for an action to make sense. For example, if Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, there might be a tension like 'prisoner' because she was tied up.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one and think about what tensions must exist for the action to occur.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This event sets up the story but doesn't directly involve characters, so no specific tension is required beyond the storm itself.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight's injury introduces a health risk, so this action requires a 'health_at_risk' tension for him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: These actions are taken because of Jaguar Knight's injuries, maintaining the 'health_at_risk' tension.\n\n4. **character_recuperate**: This action resolves the health risk, so no ongoing tension is needed here.\n\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **tie_character_to_rock**: These introduce a 'prisoner' tension for Princess.\n   \n6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight's prayer is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, maintaining the 'prisoner' tension.\n\n7. **search_for_enemy**, **attack_with_dagger**, etc.: All these actions are taken under the context of rescuing a prisoner and involve risks like 'life_at_risk'.\n\n8. **liberate_princess**: This action resolves the 'prisoner' tension but introduces a new emotional link (love).\n\n9. **kiss_character**: This action follows from the established love between Jaguar Knight and Princess.\n\n10. **recognize_tattoo**: This creates clashing emotions in Princess, introducing a 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\n11. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**, **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, etc.: These actions are driven by the clashing emotions leading to tragic consequences like deaths.\n\n12. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: This results from grief over Jaguar Knight's death, maintaining the 'character_dead' tension.\n\nI need to map each action to the relevant tensions, considering both the subject ('a') and object ('b'). For example, if Princess is tied up, the tension is on her ('b'), while Jaguar Knight's prayer relates to rescuing her ('b').\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `tensions` array within the `preconditions` of each action. Each tension will specify its type and which characters are involved as 'from' and 'to'.\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions related to tensions are clearly defined based on the story context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in the given story analysis. Postconditions are changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from an action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they can't be the same as preconditions if those exist.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand Emotional Links and Tensions**: Emotional links can be friendship or love, with magnitudes from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, etc.\n\n2. **Postconditions Definition**:\n   - For emotional links: If an action positively affects the object, the object develops a positive link towards the subject. If negatively affected, it's negative.\n   - For tensions: Actions can resolve or introduce new tensions.\n\n3. **Special Normal Tensions**: These include life_normal (resolves life_at_risk), health_normal (resolves health_at_risk), and prisoner_freed (resolves prisoner).\n\n4. **Process Each Action**:\n   - Start with the first action, \"storm_damage_bridge\". It doesn't involve characters, so no emotional links, but introduces a tension like 'health_at_risk' for Jaguar Knight.\n   - For \"prepare_curative_plasma\" and similar actions, Princess's positive action leads to Jaguar Knight developing a positive friendship link towards her. Also, using the plasma might reduce his health risk, introducing 'health_normal'.\n   - Actions like \"enemy_kidnap_princess\" introduce 'prisoner' tension for Princess.\n   - Combat actions (\"attack_with_dagger\", etc.) likely increase negative emotional links and tensions like 'life_at_risk'.\n   - The rescue action (\"liberate_princess\") resolves the 'prisoner' tension, introducing 'prisoner_freed', and strengthens their love link.\n   - Recognition of the tattoo introduces 'clashing_emotions' for Princess due to conflicting feelings.\n   - Tragic actions at the end introduce 'character_dead' tensions and resolve any remaining ones.\n\n5. **Ensure Postconditions Aren't Same as Preconditions**: If an action has preconditions, ensure the postconditions are different or new.\n\n6. **Structure JSON Accordingly**: For each action, add a `postconditions` object with `emotional_links` and `tensions` arrays, specifying changes resulting from the action.\n\nI'll go through each action methodically, ensuring that postconditions reflect logical outcomes based on the story context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

Alright, so I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. If an action has only one character (`n_characters`: 1), then both 'a' and 'b' should not be used; only 'a' is valid.

First, I'll go through each action:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: `n_characters` is 1, but preconditions and postconditions don't reference any characters. This seems okay, but maybe the tension should be applied to a general character ('*'), not specific ones since no characters are involved.

2. **character_injured_head**: Only 'jaguar_knight' is affected, so 'b' shouldn't be used here. The postconditions correctly use '*' for health_at_risk.

3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and similar actions: Both 'a' (princess) and 'b' (jaguar_knight) are appropriately used since there are two characters involved.

4. Actions like "enemy_kidnap_princess" involve two characters, so using both 'a' and 'b' makes sense. The tensions correctly reflect the prisoner status on 'b'.

5. **character_recuperate**: Only one character ('jaguar_knight'), so using 'b' might be incorrect. Should use 'a' instead.

6. Combat actions ("attack_with_dagger", etc.) involve two characters, so both 'a' and 'b' are correctly used in preconditions and postconditions.

7. **liberate_princess**: After liberating, 'prisoner_freed' should resolve the tension, which is correctly applied to '*'.

8. **kiss_character**: Involves two characters, but using 'a' and 'b' seems okay since both are involved.

9. **recognize_tattoo** and subsequent actions: These involve Princess recognizing something about Jaguar Knight, so the emotional links should be from her ('a') to him ('b'). The clashing emotions tension is correctly applied to '*'.

10. Tragic endings ("cut_jugular_with_dagger", etc.) introduce 'character_dead' tensions, which are correctly applied without referencing dead characters in other ways.

I also need to ensure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. For example, after Jaguar Knight dies, Princess's actions shouldn't reference him in new emotional links.

Another point is ensuring that postconditions aren't the same as preconditions. For instance, if an action starts with a health_at_risk tension, it should resolve with health_normal, not introduce another similar tension.

Lastly, verifying that 'a' refers to the subject and 'b' to the object in all cases, avoiding any misuse of these identifiers.

time=2025-04-09T15:06:45.021-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking for a narrative analysis of a given story, focusing on emotional links and tensions. They provided specific types for both, so first, I should make sure I understand those correctly.\n\nThe user wants me to extract actions from the main characters that relate to emotional relationships (either friendship or love) and build tension in the story. The tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition.\n\nLooking at the story, it's about Jaguar Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I need to go through each event step by step, identify the key actions, and categorize them under the specified types.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages a bridge, leading to Jaguar Knight's injury. That's a clear case of health at risk for him. Then Princess uses a curative plant to save him, which shows a positive emotional link, likely friendship since it's about saving his life without romantic elements yet.\n\nNext, the enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces the prisoner tension and puts her life at risk. Jaguar Knight decides to rescue her, leading to an action where he liberates her, further building their bond—now potentially shifting towards love as she admires him.\n\nHowever, there's a twist when Princess recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates what he did. The tension here is significant because it leads to tragic consequences: she kills him and then herself.\n\nI need to structure each action in chronological order, using the JSON format specified. Each action should have subject, object, and n_characters. I must avoid character names and keep actions simple for reusability.\n\nSo, breaking down the story:\n\n1. Storm causes bridge collapse (health at risk).\n2. Princess saves Jaguar Knight (friendship link).\n3. Enemy kidnaps Princess (prisoner tension).\n4. Jaguar Knight searches and finds enemy.\n5.

An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help the user convert their JSON story analysis into this DPS format. First, let me make sure I understand what DPS is. From the example given, it looks like DPS starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action has a subject, an action verb, and an object, all separated by spaces.\n\nLooking back at the JSON provided earlier, each action is structured with \"subject,\" \"action,\" and \"object.\" Some actions have both subject and object, while others might only have one or neither. For example, \"storm_damage_bridge\" doesn't involve any specific characters, so in DPS, it would just be that action without a subject or object.\n\nNow, I need to go through each JSON entry and translate it into the DPS syntax. That means for every action in the JSON array, I'll create a corresponding line in the DPS format. If an action has both subject and object, I'll include them; if not, I'll omit them accordingly.\n\nLet's take the first few actions:\n\n1. \"storm_damage_bridge\" – no subject or object, so it's just that.\n2. \"character_injured_head\" – here, the object is \"jaguar_knight,\" but there's no subject since the storm caused the injury. So, maybe I can represent this as \"-\" injured_head \"jaguar_knight.\"\n\nWait, in DPS, if the subject is missing, do we just omit it? From the example, actions like \"Was_In_Love_With\" have both subject and object, but for actions without a subject or object, they seem to be absent. So perhaps I should represent it as \"- injured_head jaguar_knight.\"\n\nBut looking at the example again, all actions have both subject and object, so maybe in cases where one is missing, we can use \"-\" to indicate absence.\n\nContinuing this way for each action:\n\n- \"prepare_curative_plasma\" has subject \"princess\" and object \"jaguar_knight,\" so it would be \"princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight.\"\n- \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\" similarly would be \"princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight.\"\n\nFor actions where both subject and object are the same, like \"cut_own_throat_with_dagger,\" it's represented as \"princess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess.\" But wait, in the DPS example, actions don't have repeated characters, so maybe I should just list it once or find another way. Alternatively, since DPS allows for actions to have both subject and object, even if they are the same character, it's okay.\n\nI also need to ensure that the action strings match exactly as in the JSON. For example, \"liberate_princess\" becomes \"jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess.\"\n\nGoing through each action step by step and converting them accordingly should give me the complete DPS structure. I'll make sure to handle cases where subject or object are missing by using \"-\" appropriately.\n\nFinally, wrapping everything up with \"Sto\" at the beginning and enclosing it within <DPS> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\n- storm_damage_bridge -\n- character_injured_head jaguar_knight\nprincess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\nprincess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\n- character_recuperate jaguar_knight\nenemy enemy_kidnap_princess princess\nenemy tie_character_to_rock princess\njaguar_knight character_pray_for_wisdom -\njaguar_knight search_for_enemy enemy\njaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\njaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\njaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\n- imitate_sacred_ceremony -\njaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nprincess kiss_character jaguar_knight\n- recognize_tattoo princess\n- invoke_god_of_the_dead -\nprincess cut_jugular_with_dagger jaguar_knight\n- character_bleed_to_death jaguar_knight\nprincess cut_own_throat_with_dagger princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user wants me to identify or infer these preconditions based on the actions described.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an emotional link is. Emotional links can be either `friendship` (platonic) or `love` (romantic), and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. Negative magnitudes indicate negative emotions like hatred or anger, while positive ones indicate affection or love.\n\nPreconditions are the requirements that must be met for an action to make sense. For example, if character A attacks character B, there might be a precondition that character A feels hatred towards character B (negative friendship link).\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one and try to infer the necessary emotional links.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This is an event caused by Tlaloc, so no characters are involved. No preconditions needed.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight gets injured. No specific emotional link is required here; it's just an event happening to him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess prepares the plasma to help Jaguar Knight. This suggests a positive friendship or love link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight, perhaps magnitude 2 (affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to preparing the plasma, this action would require the same positive emotional link from Princess towards Jaguar Knight.\n\n5. **character_recuperate**: Jaguar Knight gets better. No specific precondition here; it's a result of the princess's actions.\n\n6. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess. This implies a negative emotional link from Enemy towards Princess, maybe hatred with magnitude -3.\n\n7. **tie_character_to_rock**: Enemy ties Princess up. Again, this action follows from the kidnapping and requires the same negative emotional link (hatred).\n\n8. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight prays for wisdom to rescue Princess. This suggests a positive emotional link towards Princess, indicating love or strong friendship.\n\n9. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar Knight searches for Enemy to save Princess. This again stems from his positive feelings towards Princess and a desire to protect her.\n\n10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: These actions are driven by Jaguar Knight's anger or determination to rescue Princess, so they might require a negative emotional link towards Enemy (hatred) and a positive one towards Princess (love).\n\n11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: This is more of a ritualistic action following the battle, so no specific emotional precondition beyond what led to the victory.\n\n12. **liberate_princess**: Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, which requires his positive emotional link towards her.\n\n13. **kiss_character**: Princess kisses Jaguar Knight, indicating mutual romantic feelings (love), so both should have a positive love link towards each other with high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n14. **recognize_tattoo**: Princess recognizes the tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves Jaguar Knight but hates his actions, leading to a negative emotional link (hatred) towards him.\n\n15. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**: Princess invokes Huitzilopochtli before killing Jaguar Knight and herself. This might stem from her conflicting emotions—love turned to hatred.\n\n16. **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, **character_bleed_to_death**: These actions are driven by Princess's hatred towards Jaguar Knight after recognizing the tattoo, indicating a negative emotional link (magnitude -3).\n\n17. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: Princess kills herself, which could be driven by grief or guilt related to her actions, possibly linked to her love for Jaguar Knight turned to tragedy.\n\nIn each case, I need to specify whether the precondition is about friendship or love and assign a magnitude based on the context of the story. For example, rescuing actions are driven by positive emotions (love), while attacking actions are driven by negative ones (hatred).\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `preconditions` key to each action in the JSON, with an array of emotional links. Each link will specify the type (`friendship` or `love`), magnitude (-3 to 3), and which characters are involved (`from` and `to` as 'a' for subject and 'b' for object).\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions are clearly defined based on the inferred emotional links.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

For example, if Jaguar Knight rescues Princess, there might be a tension like 'prisoner' because she was tied up.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one and think about what tensions must exist for the action to occur.\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: This event sets up the story but doesn't directly involve characters, so no specific tension is required beyond the storm itself.\n   \n2. **character_injured_head**: Jaguar Knight's injury introduces a health risk, so this action requires a 'health_at_risk' tension for him.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: These actions are taken because of Jaguar Knight's injuries, maintaining the 'health_at_risk' tension.\n\n4. **character_recuperate**: This action resolves the health risk, so no ongoing tension is needed here.\n\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **tie_character_to_rock**: These introduce a 'prisoner' tension for Princess.\n   \n6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Jaguar Knight's prayer is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, maintaining the 'prisoner' tension.\n\n7. **search_for_enemy**, **attack_with_dagger**, etc.: All these actions are taken under the context of rescuing a prisoner and involve risks like 'life_at_risk'.\n\n8. **liberate_princess**: This action resolves the 'prisoner' tension but introduces a new emotional link (love).\n\n9. **kiss_character**: This action follows from the established love between Jaguar Knight and Princess.\n\n10. **recognize_tattoo**: This creates clashing emotions in Princess, introducing a 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\n11. **invoke_god_of_the_dead**, **cut_jugular_with_dagger**, etc.: These actions are driven by the clashing emotions leading to tragic consequences like deaths.\n\n12. **cut_own_throat_with_dagger**: This results from grief over Jaguar Knight's death, maintaining the 'character_dead' tension.\n\nI need to map each action to the relevant tensions, considering both the subject ('a') and object ('b'). For example, if Princess is tied up, the tension is on her ('b'), while Jaguar Knight's prayer relates to rescuing her ('b').\n\nI'll structure this by adding a `tensions` array within the `preconditions` of each action. Each tension will specify its type and which characters are involved as 'from' and 'to'.\n\nThis way, each action's preconditions related to tensions are clearly defined based on the story context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in the given story analysis. Postconditions are changes to emotional links or tensions resulting from an action. At least one postcondition is required per action, and they can't be the same as preconditions if those exist.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand Emotional Links and Tensions**: Emotional links can be friendship or love, with magnitudes from -3 to 3. Tensions include things like health at risk, prisoner, clashing emotions, etc.\n\n2. **Postconditions Definition**:\n   - For emotional links: If an action positively affects the object, the object develops a positive link towards the subject. If negatively affected, it's negative.\n   - For tensions: Actions can resolve or introduce new tensions.\n\n3. **Special Normal Tensions**: These include life_normal (resolves life_at_risk), health_normal (resolves health_at_risk), and prisoner_freed (resolves prisoner).\n\n4. **Process Each Action**:\n   - Start with the first action, \"storm_damage_bridge\". It doesn't involve characters, so no emotional links, but introduces a tension like 'health_at_risk' for Jaguar Knight.\n   - For \"prepare_curative_plasma\" and similar actions, Princess's positive action leads to Jaguar Knight developing a positive friendship link towards her. Also, using the plasma might reduce his health risk, introducing 'health_normal'.\n   - Actions like \"enemy_kidnap_princess\" introduce 'prisoner' tension for Princess.\n   - Combat actions (\"attack_with_dagger\", etc.) likely increase negative emotional links and tensions like 'life_at_risk'.\n   - The rescue action (\"liberate_princess\") resolves the 'prisoner' tension, introducing 'prisoner_freed', and strengthens their love link.\n   - Recognition of the tattoo introduces 'clashing_emotions' for Princess due to conflicting feelings.\n   - Tragic actions at the end introduce 'character_dead' tensions and resolve any remaining ones.\n\n5. **Ensure Postconditions Aren't Same as Preconditions**: If an action has preconditions, ensure the postconditions are different or new.\n\n6. **Structure JSON Accordingly**: For each action, add a `postconditions` object with `emotional_links` and `tensions` arrays, specifying changes resulting from the action.\n\nI'll go through each action methodically, ensuring that postconditions reflect logical outcomes based on the story context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to ensure logical consistency in the JSON by verifying that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. If an action has only one character (`n_characters`: 1), then both 'a' and 'b' should not be used; only 'a' is valid.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: `n_characters` is 1, but preconditions and postconditions don't reference any characters. This seems okay, but maybe the tension should be applied to a general character ('*'), not specific ones since no characters are involved.\n\n2. **character_injured_head**: Only 'jaguar_knight' is affected, so 'b' shouldn't be used here. The postconditions correctly use '*' for health_at_risk.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma** and similar actions: Both 'a' (princess) and 'b' (jaguar_knight) are appropriately used since there are two characters involved.\n\n4. Actions like \"enemy_kidnap_princess\" involve two characters, so using both 'a' and 'b' makes sense. The tensions correctly reflect the prisoner status on 'b'.\n\n5. **character_recuperate**: Only one character ('jaguar_knight'), so using 'b' might be incorrect. Should use 'a' instead.\n\n6. Combat actions (\"attack_with_dagger\", etc.) involve two characters, so both 'a' and 'b' are correctly used in preconditions and postconditions.\n\n7. **liberate_princess**: After liberating, 'prisoner_freed' should resolve the tension, which is correctly applied to '*'.\n\n8. **kiss_character**: Involves two characters, but using 'a' and 'b' seems okay since both are involved.\n\n9. **recognize_tattoo** and subsequent actions: These involve Princess recognizing something about Jaguar Knight, so the emotional links should be from her ('a') to him ('b'). The clashing emotions tension is correctly applied to '*'.\n\n10. Tragic endings (\"cut_jugular_with_dagger\", etc.) introduce 'character_dead' tensions, which are correctly applied without referencing dead characters in other ways.\n\nI also need to ensure that if a character dies, they don't have any further emotional links or tensions. For example, after Jaguar Knight dies, Princess's actions shouldn't reference him in new emotional links.\n\nAnother point is ensuring that postconditions aren't the same as preconditions. For instance, if an action starts with a health_at_risk tension, it should resolve with health_normal, not introduce another similar tension.\n\nLastly, verifying that 'a' refers to the subject and 'b' to the object in all cases, avoiding any misuse of these identifiers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

Alright, I need to convert the provided JSON into PAD language based on the given syntax rules. Let's break down what needs to be done.

First, understand the structure of PAD:
- Each action starts with 'ACT'.
- The action name and number of characters involved.
- Optional 'PRE' section for preconditions (emotional links and tensions).
- Required 'POS' section for postconditions (emotional links and tensions).

The JSON contains actions with preconditions and postconditions. For each action, I'll map these to PAD's syntax.

Starting with the first action:
"storm_damage_bridge" has no characters involved ('n_characters': 1), but affects Jaguar Knight's health. In PAD, this would translate to an action affecting a single character with a health risk tension.

Next, "character_injured_head" affects Jaguar Knight and introduces a health_at_risk tension. The postconditions should resolve this tension with 'health_normal'.

For actions involving two characters like "prepare_curative_plasma", I'll specify both subject (a) and object (b). Preconditions include friendship links, and postconditions strengthen these links or resolve tensions.

Combat actions like "attack_with_dagger" involve negative emotional links leading to tensions. These should be reflected in the 'PRE' and 'POS' sections accordingly.

The liberation action resolves the prisoner tension with 'prisoner_freed', while recognition of the tattoo introduces clashing emotions, affecting Princess's emotional state.

Tragic endings introduce 'character_dead' tensions without further emotional links, ensuring logical consistency by not referencing dead characters afterward.

I'll ensure that each PAD block accurately represents the JSON's preconditions and postconditions, using appropriate syntax for emotional links and tensions.
