Story:  There was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.

The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.

"My brothers," said he, "may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger."

The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:

"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine."

Tho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.

When the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.

Scarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:

"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) "has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him."

"Tell thy master," said the King, "that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure."

Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.

The Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:

"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me."

The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.

While he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:

"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning."

At this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.

While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out "Thieves, thieves," several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.

The King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:

"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat."

The King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.

"To my lord Marquis of Carabas," answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.

"Truly a fine estate," said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.

"You see, sir," said the Marquis, "this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year."[73]

The Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:

"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat."

The King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. "To my lord Marquis of Carabas," replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.

The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.

Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.

The Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.

"I have been assured," said the Cat, "that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like."

"This is true," answered the Ogre very briskly, "and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion."

Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.

"I have been moreover informed," said the Cat, "but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible."

"Impossible?" cried the Ogre, "you shall see that presently," and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.

Puss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.

Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:

"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas."

"What! my lord Marquis?" cried the King, "and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please."

The Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:

"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law."

The Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.

Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.

Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
There was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.

The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.

"My brothers," said he, "may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger."

The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:

"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine."

Tho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.

When the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.

Scarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:

"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) "has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him."

"Tell thy master," said the King, "that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure."

Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.

The Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:

<think>
Alright, I need to analyze this story about the miller's sons and Puss in Boots. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like characters dying or being prisoners). 

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It starts with a miller who leaves his three sons his mill, ass, and cat. The youngest son is upset because he only gets the cat, but Puss promises to help him.

So, the first emotional link here is friendship between the youngest son (let's call him the Marquis) and Puss. Puss shows loyalty by offering to help, which strengthens their bond.

Next, Puss starts helping by catching rabbits and partridges for the King. This builds trust and friendship as Puss proves himself reliable.

Then, Puss devises a plan to make the Marquis appear wealthy. He helps the Marquis by stealing his clothes and making him look like a noble, which shows deep friendship and loyalty. The Marquis follows Puss's advice without question, indicating trust.

When the King invites the Marquis into his coach, the Princess falls in love with him. That's a romantic emotional link between them. Their interaction is brief but intense, leading to marriage.

Puss continues to help by intimidating workers into lying about the Marquis owning land, which helps build the Marquis's reputation and secures his place with the royal family.

Finally, Puss tricks an Ogre into turning into a mouse and eats him. This removes a tension (Ogre being a threat) but doesn't involve emotional links. The story ends with the Marquis marrying the Princess, solidifying their love, and Puss becoming a noble, showing his friendship paid off.

I need to list these actions in order, noting each emotional link or tension involved without using character names, just subjects and objects. Each action should be simple, like "cat_asked_master_for_bag", with n_characters indicating how many are involved. Tensions here are mostly about characters being at risk, but the Ogre's death is a key point.

I'll structure this into JSON, ensuring each action is clear and follows the user's instructions.

time=2025-04-14T13:36:43.665-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nThere was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.\n\nThe poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.\"\n\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n\n\"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine.\"\n\nTho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.\n\nWhen the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\n\nScarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n\n\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"\n\n\"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.\n\nThe Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:\n\n\"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.\n\nWhile he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:\n\n\"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning.\"\n\nAt this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.\n\nWhile they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out \"Thieves, thieves,\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThe King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n\n\"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.\n\n\"Truly a fine estate,\" said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the Marquis, \"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\"[73]\n\nThe Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.\n\nThe Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.\n\nThe Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n\n\"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" answered the Ogre very briskly, \"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\"\n\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n\n\"I have been moreover informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" cried the Ogre, \"you shall see that presently,\" and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.\n\nPuss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.\n\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:\n\n\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\"\n\n\"What! my lord Marquis?\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\"\n\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:\n\n\"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\"\n\nThe Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\n\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story about the miller's sons and Puss in Boots. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like characters dying or being prisoners). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It starts with a miller who leaves his three sons his mill, ass, and cat. The youngest son is upset because he only gets the cat, but Puss promises to help him.\n\nSo, the first emotional link here is friendship between the youngest son (let's call him the Marquis) and Puss. Puss shows loyalty by offering to help, which strengthens their bond.\n\nNext, Puss starts helping by catching rabbits and partridges for the King. This builds trust and friendship as Puss proves himself reliable.\n\nThen, Puss devises a plan to make the Marquis appear wealthy. He helps the Marquis by stealing his clothes and making him look like a noble, which shows deep friendship and loyalty. The Marquis follows Puss's advice without question, indicating trust.\n\nWhen the King invites the Marquis into his coach, the Princess falls in love with him. That's a romantic emotional link between them. Their interaction is brief but intense, leading to marriage.\n\nPuss continues to help by intimidating workers into lying about the Marquis owning land, which helps build the Marquis's reputation and secures his place with the royal family.\n\nFinally, Puss tricks an Ogre into turning into a mouse and eats him. This removes a tension (Ogre being a threat) but doesn't involve emotional links. The story ends with the Marquis marrying the Princess, solidifying their love, and Puss becoming a noble, showing his friendship paid off.\n\nI need to list these actions in order, noting each emotional link or tension involved without using character names, just subjects and objects. Each action should be simple, like \"cat_asked_master_for_bag\", with n_characters indicating how many are involved. Tensions here are mostly about characters being at risk, but the Ogre's death is a key point.\n\nI'll structure this into JSON, ensuring each action is clear and follows the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_promised_help_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"cat\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_partridges_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_advised_master_to_wash_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_washed_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_cried_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_sent_guards_to_help_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_told_king_clothes_were_stolen\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_gave_master_new_clothes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_mowers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_meadow\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mowers_told_king_meadow_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mowers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_reapers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_corn\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"reapers_told_king_corn_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"reapers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_entered_ogre_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_lion\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_hid_in_gutter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_ate_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mouse\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_visited_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"marquis_married_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"marquis\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

Alright, I need to analyze each action in the story to identify preconditions related to emotional links. The user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love, and assign a magnitude from -3 to 3.

First, I'll go through each action one by one. For actions where an emotional link is necessary for the character to perform that action, I'll note the type, magnitude, and direction (from subject 'a' to object 'b').

Starting with "youngest_son_felt_sad": there's no interaction with another character here, so no emotional links involved. Preconditions are empty.

Next, "cat_promised_help_to_master": The cat helps because he cares about his master, indicating a positive friendship link from the cat (a) to the master (b). I'll set magnitude to 2 as it shows loyalty but not the deepest bond yet.

"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat": The master trusts the cat enough to provide items, suggesting a moderate trust, so friendship from master (a) to cat (b) with magnitude 2.

"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag": No direct emotional link here; it's about the cat's ability. Preconditions remain empty.

"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king": The cat wants to help his master by gaining favor, indicating friendship from cat (a) to king (b), but since they're just meeting, magnitude is 1.

Similarly, "cat_caught_partridges_in_bag" and presenting them involves the same motivation, so preconditions repeat.

When advising the master to wash in the river, the cat's action is based on their existing friendship. The master follows without question, showing trust: friendship from master (a) to cat (b), magnitude 2.

The master washing in the river doesn't require an emotional link as it's following advice.

"cat_cried_for_help": This shows the cat cares about his master, so friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.

King sending guards is based on trust built by previous actions. The king trusts the cat, so friendship from king (a) to cat (b), magnitude 1.

Cat telling king clothes were stolen is again based on their bond: friendship from cat (a) to king (b), magnitude 1.

King giving new clothes is driven by his trust in the cat and the master. Friendship from king (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.

Princess falling in love with the master happens after they meet, so a romantic link from princess (a) to master (b), magnitude 3 as it's an intense feeling.

The cat intimidating mowers and reapers is about friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2 each time, ensuring the master gains a good reputation.

Finally, when the marquis marries the princess, their love is solidified. It requires a romantic link of magnitude 3 from both sides: marquis (a) to princess (b) and vice versa.

Throughout this process, I ensure that each emotional link makes sense contextually and adjust magnitudes based on the intensity of the relationship at that point in the story.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nThere was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.\n\nThe poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.\"\n\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n\n\"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine.\"\n\nTho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.\n\nWhen the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\n\nScarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n\n\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"\n\n\"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.\n\nThe Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:\n\n\"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.\n\nWhile he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:\n\n\"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning.\"\n\nAt this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.\n\nWhile they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out \"Thieves, thieves,\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThe King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n\n\"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.\n\n\"Truly a fine estate,\" said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the Marquis, \"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\"[73]\n\nThe Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.\n\nThe Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.\n\nThe Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n\n\"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" answered the Ogre very briskly, \"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\"\n\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n\n\"I have been moreover informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" cried the Ogre, \"you shall see that presently,\" and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.\n\nPuss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.\n\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:\n\n\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\"\n\n\"What! my lord Marquis?\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\"\n\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:\n\n\"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\"\n\nThe Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\n\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story about the miller's sons and Puss in Boots. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like characters dying or being prisoners). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It starts with a miller who leaves his three sons his mill, ass, and cat. The youngest son is upset because he only gets the cat, but Puss promises to help him.\n\nSo, the first emotional link here is friendship between the youngest son (let's call him the Marquis) and Puss. Puss shows loyalty by offering to help, which strengthens their bond.\n\nNext, Puss starts helping by catching rabbits and partridges for the King. This builds trust and friendship as Puss proves himself reliable.\n\nThen, Puss devises a plan to make the Marquis appear wealthy. He helps the Marquis by stealing his clothes and making him look like a noble, which shows deep friendship and loyalty. The Marquis follows Puss's advice without question, indicating trust.\n\nWhen the King invites the Marquis into his coach, the Princess falls in love with him. That's a romantic emotional link between them. Their interaction is brief but intense, leading to marriage.\n\nPuss continues to help by intimidating workers into lying about the Marquis owning land, which helps build the Marquis's reputation and secures his place with the royal family.\n\nFinally, Puss tricks an Ogre into turning into a mouse and eats him. This removes a tension (Ogre being a threat) but doesn't involve emotional links. The story ends with the Marquis marrying the Princess, solidifying their love, and Puss becoming a noble, showing his friendship paid off.\n\nI need to list these actions in order, noting each emotional link or tension involved without using character names, just subjects and objects.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love, and assign a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For actions where an emotional link is necessary for the character to perform that action, I'll note the type, magnitude, and direction (from subject 'a' to object 'b').\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": there's no interaction with another character here, so no emotional links involved. Preconditions are empty.\n\nNext, \"cat_promised_help_to_master\": The cat helps because he cares about his master, indicating a positive friendship link from the cat (a) to the master (b). I'll set magnitude to 2 as it shows loyalty but not the deepest bond yet.\n\n\"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\": The master trusts the cat enough to provide items, suggesting a moderate trust, so friendship from master (a) to cat (b) with magnitude 2.\n\n\"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\": No direct emotional link here; it's about the cat's ability. Preconditions remain empty.\n\n\"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\": The cat wants to help his master by gaining favor, indicating friendship from cat (a) to king (b), but since they're just meeting, magnitude is 1.\n\nSimilarly, \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\" and presenting them involves the same motivation, so preconditions repeat.\n\nWhen advising the master to wash in the river, the cat's action is based on their existing friendship. The master follows without question, showing trust: friendship from master (a) to cat (b), magnitude 2.\n\nThe master washing in the river doesn't require an emotional link as it's following advice.\n\n\"cat_cried_for_help\": This shows the cat cares about his master, so friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nKing sending guards is based on trust built by previous actions. The king trusts the cat, so friendship from king (a) to cat (b), magnitude 1.\n\nCat telling king clothes were stolen is again based on their bond: friendship from cat (a) to king (b), magnitude 1.\n\nKing giving new clothes is driven by his trust in the cat and the master. Friendship from king (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nPrincess falling in love with the master happens after they meet, so a romantic link from princess (a) to master (b), magnitude 3 as it's an intense feeling.\n\nThe cat intimidating mowers and reapers is about friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2 each time, ensuring the master gains a good reputation.\n\nFinally, when the marquis marries the princess, their love is solidified. It requires a romantic link of magnitude 3 from both sides: marquis (a) to princess (b) and vice versa.\n\nThroughout this process, I ensure that each emotional link makes sense contextually and adjust magnitudes based on the intensity of the relationship at that point in the story.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

Alright, I need to analyze each action in the story to identify preconditions related to tensions. The user wants me to focus on specific tension types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, and prisoner.

Starting with "youngest_son_felt_sad": there's no direct tension here, so the array is empty.

"cat_promised_help_to_master": No immediate tension; it's about loyalty. Preconditions for tensions are empty.

"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat": Again, this action doesn't involve any tension as it's a supportive act.

"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag": This action is about providing food, no tension involved.

"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king": The cat wants to gain favor but there's no direct threat. No tensions here.

Similarly, "cat_caught_partridges_in_bag" and presenting them don't involve tension.

When the cat advises the master to wash in the river, it's a setup for future tension when the master is perceived as drowning. So, the action requires that the master's life is at risk (life_at_risk), with 'a' being the source and 'b' as the recipient.

The master washing in the river doesn't have its own tension precondition but leads to one in the next action.

"cat_cried_for_help": This directly relates to the previous setup, so the same life_at_risk applies here.

King sending guards is a response to the perceived drowning (life_at_risk). The source is 'a' (king), and recipient is 'b' (master).

Cat telling king clothes were stolen doesn't involve tension but sets up for the king providing clothes. No tensions here.

King giving new clothes also doesn't involve direct tension; it's a response to theft, not an immediate threat.

"princess_fell_in_love_with_master": This is an emotional link, no tension involved.

When the cat threatens mowers and reapers, there's an implied life_at_risk if they don't comply. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient is 'b' (mowers or reapers).

King asking about meadows and corn doesn't involve tension; it's informational.

Cat entering the ogre's castle introduces a potential threat from the ogre, so life_at_risk with 'a' as the cat and '*' indicating any character.

Ogre transforming into a lion creates direct life_at_risk for the cat. Source is 'b' (ogre), recipient 'a' (cat).

Cat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to the tension created by the ogre's transformation, so same as above.

Ogre transforming into a mouse doesn't involve tension; it's part of the trick.

Cat eating the mouse removes the tension. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient 'b' (mouse).

King visiting the castle doesn't involve tension but follows from earlier setup.

Finally, marquis marrying princess has no tension as it resolves the story positively.

I need to ensure that each action's tensions are correctly identified and linked to the appropriate characters. The magnitude of tension varies, with life_at_risk being most common here.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nThere was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.\n\nThe poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.\"\n\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n\n\"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine.\"\n\nTho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.\n\nWhen the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\n\nScarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n\n\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"\n\n\"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.\n\nThe Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:\n\n\"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.\n\nWhile he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:\n\n\"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning.\"\n\nAt this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.\n\nWhile they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out \"Thieves, thieves,\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThe King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n\n\"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.\n\n\"Truly a fine estate,\" said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the Marquis, \"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\"[73]\n\nThe Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.\n\nThe Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.\n\nThe Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n\n\"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" answered the Ogre very briskly, \"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\"\n\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n\n\"I have been moreover informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" cried the Ogre, \"you shall see that presently,\" and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.\n\nPuss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.\n\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:\n\n\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\"\n\n\"What! my lord Marquis?\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\"\n\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:\n\n\"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\"\n\nThe Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\n\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story about the miller's sons and Puss in Boots. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like characters dying or being prisoners). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It starts with a miller who leaves his three sons his mill, ass, and cat. The youngest son is upset because he only gets the cat, but Puss promises to help him.\n\nSo, the first emotional link here is friendship between the youngest son (let's call him the Marquis) and Puss. Puss shows loyalty by offering to help, which strengthens their bond.\n\nNext, Puss starts helping by catching rabbits and partridges for the King. This builds trust and friendship as Puss proves himself reliable.\n\nThen, Puss devises a plan to make the Marquis appear wealthy. He helps the Marquis by stealing his clothes and making him look like a noble, which shows deep friendship and loyalty. The Marquis follows Puss's advice without question, indicating trust.\n\nWhen the King invites the Marquis into his coach, the Princess falls in love with him. That's a romantic emotional link between them. Their interaction is brief but intense, leading to marriage.\n\nPuss continues to help by intimidating workers into lying about the Marquis owning land, which helps build the Marquis's reputation and secures his place with the royal family.\n\nFinally, Puss tricks an Ogre into turning into a mouse and eats him. This removes a tension (Ogre being a threat) but doesn't involve emotional links. The story ends with the Marquis marrying the Princess, solidifying their love, and Puss becoming a noble, showing his friendship paid off.\n\nI need to list these actions in order, noting each emotional link or tension involved without using character names, just subjects and objects. Each action should be simple, like \"cat_asked_master_for_bag\", with n_characters indicating how many are involved. Tensions here are mostly about characters being at risk, but the Ogre's death is a key point.\n\nI'll structure this into JSON, ensuring each action is clear and follows the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_promised_help_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"cat\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_partridges_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_advised_master_to_wash_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_washed_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_cried_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_sent_guards_to_help_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_told_king_clothes_were_stolen\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_gave_master_new_clothes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_mowers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_meadow\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mowers_told_king_meadow_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mowers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_reapers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_corn\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"reapers_told_king_corn_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"reapers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_entered_ogre_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_lion\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_hid_in_gutter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_ate_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mouse\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_visited_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"marquis_married_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"marquis\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze each action in the story to identify preconditions related to emotional links. The user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love, and assign a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For actions where an emotional link is necessary for the character to perform that action, I'll note the type, magnitude, and direction (from subject 'a' to object 'b').\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": there's no interaction with another character here, so no emotional links involved. Preconditions are empty.\n\nNext, \"cat_promised_help_to_master\": The cat helps because he cares about his master, indicating a positive friendship link from the cat (a) to the master (b). I'll set magnitude to 2 as it shows loyalty but not the deepest bond yet.\n\n\"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\": The master trusts the cat enough to provide items, suggesting a moderate trust, so friendship from master (a) to cat (b) with magnitude 2.\n\n\"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\": No direct emotional link here; it's about the cat's ability. Preconditions remain empty.\n\n\"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\": The cat wants to help his master by gaining favor, indicating friendship from cat (a) to king (b), but since they're just meeting, magnitude is 1.\n\nSimilarly, \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\" and presenting them involves the same motivation, so preconditions repeat.\n\nWhen advising the master to wash in the river, the cat's action is based on their existing friendship. The master follows without question, showing trust: friendship from master (a) to cat (b), magnitude 2.\n\nThe master washing in the river doesn't require an emotional link as it's following advice.\n\n\"cat_cried_for_help\": This shows the cat cares about his master, so friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nKing sending guards is based on trust built by previous actions. The king trusts the cat, so friendship from king (a) to cat (b), magnitude 1.\n\nCat telling king clothes were stolen is again based on their bond: friendship from cat (a) to king (b), magnitude 1.\n\nKing giving new clothes is driven by his trust in the cat and the master. Friendship from king (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nPrincess falling in love with the master happens after they meet, so a romantic link from princess (a) to master (b), magnitude 3 as it's an intense feeling.\n\nThe cat intimidating mowers and reapers is about friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2 each time, ensuring the master gains a good reputation.\n\nFinally, when the marquis marries the princess, their love is solidified. It requires a romantic link of magnitude 3 from both sides: marquis (a) to princess (b) and vice versa.\n\nThroughout this process, I ensure that each emotional link makes sense contextually and adjust magnitudes based on the intensity of the relationship at that point in the story.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze each action in the story to identify preconditions related to tensions. The user wants me to focus on specific tension types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, and prisoner.\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": there's no direct tension here, so the array is empty.\n\n\"cat_promised_help_to_master\": No immediate tension; it's about loyalty. Preconditions for tensions are empty.\n\n\"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\": Again, this action doesn't involve any tension as it's a supportive act.\n\n\"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\": This action is about providing food, no tension involved.\n\n\"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\": The cat wants to gain favor but there's no direct threat. No tensions here.\n\nSimilarly, \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\" and presenting them don't involve tension.\n\nWhen the cat advises the master to wash in the river, it's a setup for future tension when the master is perceived as drowning. So, the action requires that the master's life is at risk (life_at_risk), with 'a' being the source and 'b' as the recipient.\n\nThe master washing in the river doesn't have its own tension precondition but leads to one in the next action.\n\n\"cat_cried_for_help\": This directly relates to the previous setup, so the same life_at_risk applies here.\n\nKing sending guards is a response to the perceived drowning (life_at_risk). The source is 'a' (king), and recipient is 'b' (master).\n\nCat telling king clothes were stolen doesn't involve tension but sets up for the king providing clothes. No tensions here.\n\nKing giving new clothes also doesn't involve direct tension; it's a response to theft, not an immediate threat.\n\n\"princess_fell_in_love_with_master\": This is an emotional link, no tension involved.\n\nWhen the cat threatens mowers and reapers, there's an implied life_at_risk if they don't comply. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient is 'b' (mowers or reapers).\n\nKing asking about meadows and corn doesn't involve tension; it's informational.\n\nCat entering the ogre's castle introduces a potential threat from the ogre, so life_at_risk with 'a' as the cat and '*' indicating any character.\n\nOgre transforming into a lion creates direct life_at_risk for the cat. Source is 'b' (ogre), recipient 'a' (cat).\n\nCat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to the tension created by the ogre's transformation, so same as above.\n\nOgre transforming into a mouse doesn't involve tension; it's part of the trick.\n\nCat eating the mouse removes the tension. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient 'b' (mouse).\n\nKing visiting the castle doesn't involve tension but follows from earlier setup.\n\nFinally, marquis marrying princess has no tension as it resolves the story positively.\n\nI need to ensure that each action's tensions are correctly identified and linked to the appropriate characters. The magnitude of tension varies, with life_at_risk being most common here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so I need to figure out the postconditions for each action in this story about Puss in Boots and his master. The user wants me to focus on how actions change emotional links or tensions, ensuring that at least one postcondition is present per action and that they don't repeat preconditions.

Starting with "youngest_son_felt_sad": There's no interaction here, so emotional links remain unchanged, but the sadness might create a slight negative self-perception. Tensions-wise, nothing changes.

Next, when the cat promises help, this positive action should improve the master's trust in the cat, increasing their friendship bond. No tension changes since it's a supportive move.

The master giving items to the cat shows trust, so the emotional link of friendship from master to cat increases. Again, no tensions here as it's cooperative.

When the cat catches a rabbit, this success strengthens the cat's reliability in the master's eyes, boosting their friendship. No tension changes since it's a positive outcome.

Presenting the rabbit to the king makes the king favorably disposed towards both the cat and the master, creating new friendly links. Tensions remain unaffected as it's a peaceful interaction.

Catching partridges follows the same logic as catching rabbits; it reinforces trust and friendship. Presenting them to the king further cements positive emotional links without affecting tensions.

The cat advising the master to wash in the river is based on trust, so the master's reliance on the cat increases their friendship bond. No tension changes here since it's a strategic move.

When the master washes in the river, this action doesn't directly affect emotions but sets up future actions. No emotional links change, and no new tensions arise.

The cat crying for help is a call to action that relies on existing trust, so after this, the master feels gratitude towards the cat, enhancing their friendship. This action also resolves the life_at_risk tension as help arrives.

King sending guards to help introduces a new friendly link from the king to the master and resolves the life_at_risk tension by ensuring the master's safety.

The cat telling the king about stolen clothes maintains trust between them, so no change in emotional links. The king giving clothes is a positive action that strengthens friendship bonds without affecting tensions.

Princess falling in love with the master is a direct result of their interaction, creating a romantic link. No tensions involved here since it's a positive development.

When the cat threatens mowers and reapers, it scares them into compliance, which doesn't affect emotional links but creates a life_at_risk tension if they don't obey.

King asking about the meadow and receiving answers shows trust in the master, slightly increasing friendship. No tensions here as it's informational.

Cat entering the ogre's castle introduces potential danger, creating a life_at_risk tension for the cat.

Ogre transforming into a lion causes fear, so the cat experiences a negative emotional link towards the ogre. This also creates a life_at_risk tension for the cat.

The cat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to fear, resolving the immediate life_at_risk but leaving the underlying tension until the ogre is dealt with.

Ogre transforming into a mouse doesn't change emotions but sets up the next action where the cat eats him, resolving the tension permanently by eliminating the threat.

Cat eating the mouse removes the ogre's danger, so the life_at_risk tension is resolved, and the castle becomes safe for everyone.

King visiting the castle after these events shows trust in the master, enhancing their friendship. No tensions remain as the situation is now safe.

Finally, the marquis marrying the princess solidifies their romantic emotional link and resolves any remaining social or relational tensions through their union.

I need to ensure each action's postconditions are logically consistent with the story's flow, adjusting emotional links and resolving or introducing tensions appropriately.

time=2025-04-14T13:40:54.224-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nThere was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.\n\nThe poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.\"\n\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n\n\"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine.\"\n\nTho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.\n\nWhen the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\n\nScarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n\n\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"\n\n\"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.\n\nThe Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:\n\n\"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.\n\nWhile he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:\n\n\"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning.\"\n\nAt this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.\n\nWhile they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out \"Thieves, thieves,\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThe King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n\n\"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.\n\n\"Truly a fine estate,\" said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the Marquis, \"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\"[73]\n\nThe Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.\n\nThe Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.\n\nThe Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n\n\"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" answered the Ogre very briskly, \"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\"\n\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n\n\"I have been moreover informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" cried the Ogre, \"you shall see that presently,\" and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.\n\nPuss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.\n\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:\n\n\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\"\n\n\"What! my lord Marquis?\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\"\n\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:\n\n\"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\"\n\nThe Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\n\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story about the miller's sons and Puss in Boots. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions (like characters dying or being prisoners). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It starts with a miller who leaves his three sons his mill, ass, and cat. The youngest son is upset because he only gets the cat, but Puss promises to help him.\n\nSo, the first emotional link here is friendship between the youngest son (let's call him the Marquis) and Puss. Puss shows loyalty by offering to help, which strengthens their bond.\n\nNext, Puss starts helping by catching rabbits and partridges for the King. This builds trust and friendship as Puss proves himself reliable.\n\nThen, Puss devises a plan to make the Marquis appear wealthy. He helps the Marquis by stealing his clothes and making him look like a noble, which shows deep friendship and loyalty. The Marquis follows Puss's advice without question, indicating trust.\n\nWhen the King invites the Marquis into his coach, the Princess falls in love with him. That's a romantic emotional link between them. Their interaction is brief but intense, leading to marriage.\n\nPuss continues to help by intimidating workers into lying about the Marquis owning land, which helps build the Marquis's reputation and secures his place with the royal family.\n\nFinally, Puss tricks an Ogre into turning into a mouse and eats him. This removes a tension (Ogre being a threat) but doesn't involve emotional links. The story ends with the Marquis marrying the Princess, solidifying their love, and Puss becoming a noble, showing his friendship paid off.\n\nI need to list these actions in order, noting each emotional link or tension involved without using character names, just subjects and objects. Each action should be simple, like \"cat_asked_master_for_bag\", with n_characters indicating how many are involved. Tensions here are mostly about characters being at risk, but the Ogre's death is a key point.\n\nI'll structure this into JSON, ensuring each action is clear and follows the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_promised_help_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"cat\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_presented_partridges_to_king\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_advised_master_to_wash_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"master_washed_in_river\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"master\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_cried_for_help\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_sent_guards_to_help_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_told_king_clothes_were_stolen\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_gave_master_new_clothes\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"master\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"princess_fell_in_love_with_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_mowers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_meadow\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"mowers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"mowers_told_king_meadow_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"mowers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat-threatened_reapers\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_asked_about_corn\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"reapers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"reapers_told_king_corn_belonged_to_master\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"reapers\",\n    \"object\": \"king\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_entered_ogre_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_lion\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_hid_in_gutter\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ogre_transformed_into_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"ogre\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cat_ate_mouse\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"cat\",\n    \"object\": \"mouse\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"king_visited_castle\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"king\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"marquis_married_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"marquis\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user wants me to focus on two types of emotional links: friendship and love, and assign a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For actions where an emotional link is necessary for the character to perform that action, I'll note the type, magnitude, and direction (from subject 'a' to object 'b').\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": there's no interaction with another character here, so no emotional links involved. Preconditions are empty.\n\nNext, \"cat_promised_help_to_master\": The cat helps because he cares about his master, indicating a positive friendship link from the cat (a) to the master (b). I'll set magnitude to 2 as it shows loyalty but not the deepest bond yet.\n\n\"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\": The master trusts the cat enough to provide items, suggesting a moderate trust, so friendship from master (a) to cat (b) with magnitude 2.\n\n\"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\": No direct emotional link here; it's about the cat's ability. Preconditions remain empty.\n\n\"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\": The cat wants to help his master by gaining favor, indicating friendship from cat (a) to king (b), but since they're just meeting, magnitude is 1.\n\nSimilarly, \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\" and presenting them involves the same motivation, so preconditions repeat.\n\nWhen advising the master to wash in the river, the cat's action is based on their existing friendship. The master follows without question, showing trust: friendship from master (a) to cat (b), magnitude 2.\n\nThe master washing in the river doesn't require an emotional link as it's following advice.\n\n\"cat_cried_for_help\": This shows the cat cares about his master, so friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nKing sending guards is based on trust built by previous actions. The king trusts the cat, so friendship from king (a) to cat (b), magnitude 1.\n\nCat telling king clothes were stolen is again based on their bond: friendship from cat (a) to king (b), magnitude 1.\n\nKing giving new clothes is driven by his trust in the cat and the master. Friendship from king (a) to master (b), magnitude 2.\n\nPrincess falling in love with the master happens after they meet, so a romantic link from princess (a) to master (b), magnitude 3 as it's an intense feeling.\n\nThe cat intimidating mowers and reapers is about friendship from cat (a) to master (b), magnitude 2 each time, ensuring the master gains a good reputation.\n\nFinally, when the marquis marries the princess, their love is solidified. It requires a romantic link of magnitude 3 from both sides: marquis (a) to princess (b) and vice versa.\n\nThroughout this process, I ensure that each emotional link makes sense contextually and adjust magnitudes based on the intensity of the relationship at that point in the story.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n

The user wants me to focus on specific tension types: character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, and prisoner.\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": there's no direct tension here, so the array is empty.\n\n\"cat_promised_help_to_master\": No immediate tension; it's about loyalty. Preconditions for tensions are empty.\n\n\"master_gave_bag_and_boots_to_cat\": Again, this action doesn't involve any tension as it's a supportive act.\n\n\"cat_caught_rabbit_in_bag\": This action is about providing food, no tension involved.\n\n\"cat_presented_rabbit_to_king\": The cat wants to gain favor but there's no direct threat. No tensions here.\n\nSimilarly, \"cat_caught_partridges_in_bag\" and presenting them don't involve tension.\n\nWhen the cat advises the master to wash in the river, it's a setup for future tension when the master is perceived as drowning. So, the action requires that the master's life is at risk (life_at_risk), with 'a' being the source and 'b' as the recipient.\n\nThe master washing in the river doesn't have its own tension precondition but leads to one in the next action.\n\n\"cat_cried_for_help\": This directly relates to the previous setup, so the same life_at_risk applies here.\n\nKing sending guards is a response to the perceived drowning (life_at_risk). The source is 'a' (king), and recipient is 'b' (master).\n\nCat telling king clothes were stolen doesn't involve tension but sets up for the king providing clothes. No tensions here.\n\nKing giving new clothes also doesn't involve direct tension; it's a response to theft, not an immediate threat.\n\n\"princess_fell_in_love_with_master\": This is an emotional link, no tension involved.\n\nWhen the cat threatens mowers and reapers, there's an implied life_at_risk if they don't comply. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient is 'b' (mowers or reapers).\n\nKing asking about meadows and corn doesn't involve tension; it's informational.\n\nCat entering the ogre's castle introduces a potential threat from the ogre, so life_at_risk with 'a' as the cat and '*' indicating any character.\n\nOgre transforming into a lion creates direct life_at_risk for the cat. Source is 'b' (ogre), recipient 'a' (cat).\n\nCat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to the tension created by the ogre's transformation, so same as above.\n\nOgre transforming into a mouse doesn't involve tension; it's part of the trick.\n\nCat eating the mouse removes the tension. The source is 'a' (cat), recipient 'b' (mouse).\n\nKing visiting the castle doesn't involve tension but follows from earlier setup.\n\nFinally, marquis marrying princess has no tension as it resolves the story positively.\n\nI need to ensure that each action's tensions are correctly identified and linked to the appropriate characters. The magnitude of tension varies, with life_at_risk being most common here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n

identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the postconditions for each action in this story about Puss in Boots and his master. The user wants me to focus on how actions change emotional links or tensions, ensuring that at least one postcondition is present per action and that they don't repeat preconditions.\n\nStarting with \"youngest_son_felt_sad\": There's no interaction here, so emotional links remain unchanged, but the sadness might create a slight negative self-perception. Tensions-wise, nothing changes.\n\nNext, when the cat promises help, this positive action should improve the master's trust in the cat, increasing their friendship bond. No tension changes since it's a supportive move.\n\nThe master giving items to the cat shows trust, so the emotional link of friendship from master to cat increases. Again, no tensions here as it's cooperative.\n\nWhen the cat catches a rabbit, this success strengthens the cat's reliability in the master's eyes, boosting their friendship. No tension changes since it's a positive outcome.\n\nPresenting the rabbit to the king makes the king favorably disposed towards both the cat and the master, creating new friendly links. Tensions remain unaffected as it's a peaceful interaction.\n\nCatching partridges follows the same logic as catching rabbits; it reinforces trust and friendship. Presenting them to the king further cements positive emotional links without affecting tensions.\n\nThe cat advising the master to wash in the river is based on trust, so the master's reliance on the cat increases their friendship bond. No tension changes here since it's a strategic move.\n\nWhen the master washes in the river, this action doesn't directly affect emotions but sets up future actions. No emotional links change, and no new tensions arise.\n\nThe cat crying for help is a call to action that relies on existing trust, so after this, the master feels gratitude towards the cat, enhancing their friendship. This action also resolves the life_at_risk tension as help arrives.\n\nKing sending guards to help introduces a new friendly link from the king to the master and resolves the life_at_risk tension by ensuring the master's safety.\n\nThe cat telling the king about stolen clothes maintains trust between them, so no change in emotional links. The king giving clothes is a positive action that strengthens friendship bonds without affecting tensions.\n\nPrincess falling in love with the master is a direct result of their interaction, creating a romantic link. No tensions involved here since it's a positive development.\n\nWhen the cat threatens mowers and reapers, it scares them into compliance, which doesn't affect emotional links but creates a life_at_risk tension if they don't obey.\n\nKing asking about the meadow and receiving answers shows trust in the master, slightly increasing friendship. No tensions here as it's informational.\n\nCat entering the ogre's castle introduces potential danger, creating a life_at_risk tension for the cat.\n\nOgre transforming into a lion causes fear, so the cat experiences a negative emotional link towards the ogre. This also creates a life_at_risk tension for the cat.\n\nThe cat hiding in the gutter is a reaction to fear, resolving the immediate life_at_risk but leaving the underlying tension until the ogre is dealt with.\n\nOgre transforming into a mouse doesn't change emotions but sets up the next action where the cat eats him, resolving the tension permanently by eliminating the threat.\n\nCat eating the mouse removes the ogre's danger, so the life_at_risk tension is resolved, and the castle becomes safe for everyone.\n\nKing visiting the castle after these events shows trust in the master, enhancing their friendship. No tensions remain as the situation is now safe.\n\nFinally, the marquis marrying the princess solidifies their romantic emotional link and resolves any remaining social or relational tensions through their union.\n\nI need to ensure each action's postconditions are logically consistent with the story's flow, adjusting emotional links and resolving or introducing tensions appropriately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"youngest_son_felt_sad\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"postconditions\": {\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to ensure that each action in the provided JSON adheres to logical consistency regarding the number of characters (`n_characters`) and their references in preconditions and postconditions. Additionally, I must verify that changes due to actions (postconditions) are valid and not repetitive with preconditions.

Starting with "youngest_son_felt_sad": Since `n_characters` is 1, only 'a' should be referenced. The action doesn't involve emotional links or tensions, so it remains unchanged but requires at least one postcondition. I'll infer a slight negative self-perception as the postcondition.

For actions like "cat_promised_help_to_master" and similar, `n_characters` is 2, so 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object) are correctly used in preconditions and postconditions. Emotional links are appropriately updated without repetition.

In "cat_cried_for_help", the life_at_risk tension is resolved by help arriving, so a `life_normal` normal tension is added to postconditions.

When the ogre transforms into a lion, it creates fear for the cat, introducing a life_at_risk tension. The cat hiding resolves this with a `life_normal`.

Finally, ensuring that each action has at least one postcondition and removing any redundant or illogical entries. For example, if an action doesn't logically lead to a change in emotional links or tensions, I'll infer a minimal but valid postcondition.
