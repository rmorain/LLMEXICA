Story:  Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.

First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!

Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.

Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.

By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!"

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:
Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.

One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table.

But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.

said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.

Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.

And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.

"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"

said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears in bed
But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!

And upon the pillow——?

There was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.

The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions like character death or risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks trespasses into the Bears' house, eats their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then gets discovered. The story is more about her mischief and the Bears' reaction rather than deep emotional relationships or romantic elements.

Since the user mentioned focusing on actions related to emotional links and tensions, I need to identify any moments where characters show affection, friendship, or love. However, Goldilocks doesn't really interact with the Bears in an emotional way; she's more of a trespasser causing trouble. The Bears themselves seem to be a family unit, but their interactions are minimal beyond reacting to Goldilocks' actions.

Looking at tensions, there's no character death, health risk, or imprisonment. There is some risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and later jumps out the window, which could imply a life-at-risk situation for her. Also, the Bears discover that someone has been in their house, leading to tension as they search for the intruder.

I need to structure each action chronologically, using JSON with keys like action, n_characters, subject, object. Each action should be simple and avoid character names, using snake_case.

Let me break down the story:

1. Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge.
2. Tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.
3. Eats Little Wee Bear's porridge.
4. Sits in Great Big Bear's chair.
5. Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair.
6. Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair.
7. Sleeps in Great Big Bear's bed.
8. Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed.
9. Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed.
10. Bears return, find porridge tampered with.
11. Find chairs disturbed.
12. Discover Goldilocks asleep.
13. Goldilocks wakes up, sees Bears, escapes.

Now, for each action, I'll determine the type and whether it relates to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no emotional link beyond the Bears being upset, which is more about tension. The main tensions are life_at_risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and jumps out the window, and prisoner isn't applicable here.

I also need to check for clashing emotions or love competition, but nothing in the story fits that. So, I'll focus on actions leading to tension, specifically life_at_risk when she falls from the chair and escapes through the window.

Each JSON entry will have an action key with a description, n_characters (how many involved), subject (who did it), object (who it was done to). If there's no subject or object, use '-'.

I think that's about it. Now I'll structure each identified action into the required format.

time=2025-04-10T16:10:34.801-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions like character death or risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks trespasses into the Bears' house, eats their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then gets discovered. The story is more about her mischief and the Bears' reaction rather than deep emotional relationships or romantic elements.\n\nSince the user mentioned focusing on actions related to emotional links and tensions, I need to identify any moments where characters show affection, friendship, or love. However, Goldilocks doesn't really interact with the Bears in an emotional way; she's more of a trespasser causing trouble. The Bears themselves seem to be a family unit, but their interactions are minimal beyond reacting to Goldilocks' actions.\n\nLooking at tensions, there's no character death, health risk, or imprisonment. There is some risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and later jumps out the window, which could imply a life-at-risk situation for her. Also, the Bears discover that someone has been in their house, leading to tension as they search for the intruder.\n\nI need to structure each action chronologically, using JSON with keys like action, n_characters, subject, object. Each action should be simple and avoid character names, using snake_case.\n\nLet me break down the story:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge.\n2. Tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.\n3. Eats Little Wee Bear's porridge.\n4. Sits in Great Big Bear's chair.\n5. Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair.\n6. Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair.\n7. Sleeps in Great Big Bear's bed.\n8. Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed.\n9. Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed.\n10. Bears return, find porridge tampered with.\n11. Find chairs disturbed.\n12. Discover Goldilocks asleep.\n13. Goldilocks wakes up, sees Bears, escapes.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll determine the type and whether it relates to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no emotional link beyond the Bears being upset, which is more about tension. The main tensions are life_at_risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and jumps out the window, and prisoner isn't applicable here.\n\nI also need to check for clashing emotions or love competition, but nothing in the story fits that. So, I'll focus on actions leading to tension, specifically life_at_risk when she falls from the chair and escapes through the window.\n\nEach JSON entry will have an action key with a description, n_characters (how many involved), subject (who did it), object (who it was done to). If there's no subject or object, use '-'.\n\nI think that's about it. Now I'll structure each identified action into the required format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links.

Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I've got a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and I need to analyze each action in terms of emotional links and preconditions. The user wants me to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions.

First, I'll recall what an emotional link is. There are two types: `friendship` and `love`. Each has a magnitude from -3 to 3. A positive value indicates a stronger bond, while negative suggests dislike or hatred. Preconditions mean that before a character can perform an action, certain emotional links must exist.

Looking at the story, Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears. She's just a curious and naughty girl who happens upon their house. The Bears are a family unit, but there’s no indication of romantic love between them; it's all platonic. So, I'm mainly looking at `friendship` type links here.

Now, let's go through each action one by one:

1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. Since she doesn't know them, there’s no emotional link here. So, preconditions are empty.

2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, no prior emotional link; it's just her curiosity or hunger driving this action.

3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No emotional link here either; she’s just testing things out.

4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Same as above, no emotional connection needed.

5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This might indicate some frustration or recklessness, but that's more about her temperament than an emotional link with the Bears.

6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. Again, just exploring, no prior emotional connection.

7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Same reasoning; it’s about comfort seeking rather than any emotional tie.

8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. She’s tired from her activities, so no specific emotional link here.

9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This is more about the state of the porridge than any emotions towards Goldilocks since they don’t know her yet.

10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. Again, it's about the state of their belongings, not emotional connections.

11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is the first time they interact, so no pre-existing emotional links here.

12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. She’s startled by the noise, not due to any emotional link with him.

13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes because she's scared of being caught, again driven by fear rather than any emotional connection.

Throughout all these actions, there are no instances where an emotional link is a precondition for the action. Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears, and her actions are driven by curiosity, hunger, tiredness, or fear rather than any emotional bonds. The Bears react to the state of their belongings but don’t exhibit emotions towards Goldilocks until after these actions.

Therefore, all preconditions related to emotional links are empty because there's no existing bond that facilitates these actions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions like character death or risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks trespasses into the Bears' house, eats their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then gets discovered. The story is more about her mischief and the Bears' reaction rather than deep emotional relationships or romantic elements.\n\nSince the user mentioned focusing on actions related to emotional links and tensions, I need to identify any moments where characters show affection, friendship, or love. However, Goldilocks doesn't really interact with the Bears in an emotional way; she's more of a trespasser causing trouble. The Bears themselves seem to be a family unit, but their interactions are minimal beyond reacting to Goldilocks' actions.\n\nLooking at tensions, there's no character death, health risk, or imprisonment. There is some risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and later jumps out the window, which could imply a life-at-risk situation for her. Also, the Bears discover that someone has been in their house, leading to tension as they search for the intruder.\n\nI need to structure each action chronologically, using JSON with keys like action, n_characters, subject, object. Each action should be simple and avoid character names, using snake_case.\n\nLet me break down the story:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge.\n2. Tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.\n3. Eats Little Wee Bear's porridge.\n4. Sits in Great Big Bear's chair.\n5. Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair.\n6. Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair.\n7. Sleeps in Great Big Bear's bed.\n8. Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed.\n9. Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed.\n10. Bears return, find porridge tampered with.\n11. Find chairs disturbed.\n12. Discover Goldilocks asleep.\n13. Goldilocks wakes up, sees Bears, escapes.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll determine the type and whether it relates to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no emotional link beyond the Bears being upset, which is more about tension. The main tensions are life_at_risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and jumps out the window, and prisoner isn't applicable here.\n\nI also need to check for clashing emotions or love competition, but nothing in the story fits that. So, I'll focus on actions leading to tension, specifically life_at_risk when she falls from the chair and escapes through the window.\n\nEach JSON entry will have an action key with a description, n_characters (how many involved), subject (who did it), object (who it was done to). If there's no subject or object, use '-'.\n\nI think that's about it. Now I'll structure each identified action into the required format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

So, I've got a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and I need to analyze each action in terms of emotional links and preconditions. The user wants me to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what an emotional link is. There are two types: `friendship` and `love`. Each has a magnitude from -3 to 3. A positive value indicates a stronger bond, while negative suggests dislike or hatred. Preconditions mean that before a character can perform an action, certain emotional links must exist.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears. She's just a curious and naughty girl who happens upon their house. The Bears are a family unit, but there’s no indication of romantic love between them; it's all platonic. So, I'm mainly looking at `friendship` type links here.\n\nNow, let's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. Since she doesn't know them, there’s no emotional link here. So, preconditions are empty.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, no prior emotional link; it's just her curiosity or hunger driving this action.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No emotional link here either; she’s just testing things out.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Same as above, no emotional connection needed.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This might indicate some frustration or recklessness, but that's more about her temperament than an emotional link with the Bears.\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. Again, just exploring, no prior emotional connection.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Same reasoning; it’s about comfort seeking rather than any emotional tie.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. She’s tired from her activities, so no specific emotional link here.\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This is more about the state of the porridge than any emotions towards Goldilocks since they don’t know her yet.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. Again, it's about the state of their belongings, not emotional connections.\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is the first time they interact, so no pre-existing emotional links here.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. She’s startled by the noise, not due to any emotional link with him.\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes because she's scared of being caught, again driven by fear rather than any emotional connection.\n\nThroughout all these actions, there are no instances where an emotional link is a precondition for the action. Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears, and her actions are driven by curiosity, hunger, tiredness, or fear rather than any emotional bonds. The Bears react to the state of their belongings but don’t exhibit emotions towards Goldilocks until after these actions.\n\nTherefore, all preconditions related to emotional links are empty because there's no existing bond that facilitates these actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze each action in terms of tensions for this Goldilocks and the Three Bears story. The user wants me to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions that need to exist for each action to make sense.

First, let's recall what tensions are defined as:
1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

Now, I'll go through each action and see if any of these tensions apply as preconditions.

1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. There’s no immediate tension here; she's just curious. So, no tensions as preconditions.

2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, this is more about her hunger or curiosity, not any existing tension.

3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No tension here; she’s exploring the house.

4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Similar to above, just testing comfort.

5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This could introduce a `life_at_risk` or `health_at_risk` tension for Goldilocks because she falls and might get hurt.

6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. No inherent tension here; it’s about comfort.

7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Again, just seeking comfort.

8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. This leads to the Bears finding her later, which could introduce a `prisoner` tension if they decide to detain her.

9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could lead to `clashing_emotions` as they become upset about their property being disturbed.

10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. This adds to the tension of someone being in their house uninvited, possibly leading to `life_at_risk` if they think there's an intruder.

11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is a key moment where tensions like `prisoner` (if they decide to hold her) or `clashing_emotions` because of their anger and surprise come into play.

12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. The noise startles her, leading to tension as she realizes she's been discovered, possibly fearing for her safety (`life_at_risk`).

13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window. This action clearly puts her `life_at_risk` because falling from a height could cause injury.

Now, I need to map these tensions as preconditions where applicable. Most of the early actions don't have tension preconditions except for when she breaks the chair and when they discover her, leading to escape and potential harm.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions like character death or risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks trespasses into the Bears' house, eats their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then gets discovered. The story is more about her mischief and the Bears' reaction rather than deep emotional relationships or romantic elements.\n\nSince the user mentioned focusing on actions related to emotional links and tensions, I need to identify any moments where characters show affection, friendship, or love. However, Goldilocks doesn't really interact with the Bears in an emotional way; she's more of a trespasser causing trouble. The Bears themselves seem to be a family unit, but their interactions are minimal beyond reacting to Goldilocks' actions.\n\nLooking at tensions, there's no character death, health risk, or imprisonment. There is some risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and later jumps out the window, which could imply a life-at-risk situation for her. Also, the Bears discover that someone has been in their house, leading to tension as they search for the intruder.\n\nI need to structure each action chronologically, using JSON with keys like action, n_characters, subject, object. Each action should be simple and avoid character names, using snake_case.\n\nLet me break down the story:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge.\n2. Tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.\n3. Eats Little Wee Bear's porridge.\n4. Sits in Great Big Bear's chair.\n5. Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair.\n6. Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair.\n7. Sleeps in Great Big Bear's bed.\n8. Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed.\n9. Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed.\n10. Bears return, find porridge tampered with.\n11. Find chairs disturbed.\n12. Discover Goldilocks asleep.\n13. Goldilocks wakes up, sees Bears, escapes.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll determine the type and whether it relates to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no emotional link beyond the Bears being upset, which is more about tension. The main tensions are life_at_risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and jumps out the window, and prisoner isn't applicable here.\n\nI also need to check for clashing emotions or love competition, but nothing in the story fits that. So, I'll focus on actions leading to tension, specifically life_at_risk when she falls from the chair and escapes through the window.\n\nEach JSON entry will have an action key with a description, n_characters (how many involved), subject (who did it), object (who it was done to). If there's no subject or object, use '-'.\n\nI think that's about it. Now I'll structure each identified action into the required format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

So, I've got a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and I need to analyze each action in terms of emotional links and preconditions. The user wants me to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what an emotional link is. There are two types: `friendship` and `love`. Each has a magnitude from -3 to 3. A positive value indicates a stronger bond, while negative suggests dislike or hatred. Preconditions mean that before a character can perform an action, certain emotional links must exist.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears. She's just a curious and naughty girl who happens upon their house. The Bears are a family unit, but there’s no indication of romantic love between them; it's all platonic. So, I'm mainly looking at `friendship` type links here.\n\nNow, let's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. Since she doesn't know them, there’s no emotional link here. So, preconditions are empty.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, no prior emotional link; it's just her curiosity or hunger driving this action.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No emotional link here either; she’s just testing things out.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Same as above, no emotional connection needed.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This might indicate some frustration or recklessness, but that's more about her temperament than an emotional link with the Bears.\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. Again, just exploring, no prior emotional connection.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Same reasoning; it’s about comfort seeking rather than any emotional tie.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. She’s tired from her activities, so no specific emotional link here.\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This is more about the state of the porridge than any emotions towards Goldilocks since they don’t know her yet.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. Again, it's about the state of their belongings, not emotional connections.\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is the first time they interact, so no pre-existing emotional links here.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. She’s startled by the noise, not due to any emotional link with him.\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes because she's scared of being caught, again driven by fear rather than any emotional connection.\n\nThroughout all these actions, there are no instances where an emotional link is a precondition for the action. Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears, and her actions are driven by curiosity, hunger, tiredness, or fear rather than any emotional bonds. The Bears react to the state of their belongings but don’t exhibit emotions towards Goldilocks until after these actions.\n\nTherefore, all preconditions related to emotional links are empty because there's no existing bond that facilitates these actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

There’s no immediate tension here; she's just curious. So, no tensions as preconditions.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, this is more about her hunger or curiosity, not any existing tension.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No tension here; she’s exploring the house.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Similar to above, just testing comfort.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This could introduce a `life_at_risk` or `health_at_risk` tension for Goldilocks because she falls and might get hurt.\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. No inherent tension here; it’s about comfort.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Again, just seeking comfort.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. This leads to the Bears finding her later, which could introduce a `prisoner` tension if they decide to detain her.\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could lead to `clashing_emotions` as they become upset about their property being disturbed.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. This adds to the tension of someone being in their house uninvited, possibly leading to `life_at_risk` if they think there's an intruder.\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is a key moment where tensions like `prisoner` (if they decide to hold her) or `clashing_emotions` because of their anger and surprise come into play.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. The noise startles her, leading to tension as she realizes she's been discovered, possibly fearing for her safety (`life_at_risk`).\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window. This action clearly puts her `life_at_risk` because falling from a height could cause injury.\n\nNow, I need to map these tensions as preconditions where applicable. Most of the early actions don't have tension preconditions except for when she breaks the chair and when they discover her, leading to escape and potential harm.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions.

These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user wants me to look at changes to emotional links and tensions caused by each action, ensuring that at least one postcondition is required per action and that they aren't the same as preconditions if any existed.

First, let's recall what postconditions are: they're changes in emotional links or tensions resulting from an action. Emotional links can be of type `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes between -3 and 3. Tensions include things like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, etc., and there are also normal tensions that resolve these.

Now, I'll go through each action one by one to determine the postconditions:

1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge. She doesn't like it because it's too hot, so this might create a negative emotional link towards the Bears (friendship: -1). No direct tension is introduced here.

2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. This action shows her disregard for others' property, which could lead to a more negative emotional link (friendship: -2) from the Bears towards Goldilocks when they find out.

3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in Great Big Bear's chair and finds it too hard. Again, this is just exploration; no significant emotional change here.

4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Finds Middle-sized Bear's chair too soft. Still exploring, so minimal to no change in emotional links.

5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This action introduces a tension of `life_at_risk` for Goldilocks as she falls and could get hurt. It also likely increases negative emotions from the Bears towards her (friendship: -3).

6. **Lie in High Bed**: Finds Great Big Bear's bed too high, so no significant emotional change here.

7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Middle-sized Bear's bed is too soft; still just exploring comfort, so minimal impact on emotional links.

8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed, which leads to the Bears discovering her later. This introduces a tension of `prisoner` as they might detain her and negative emotions towards Goldilocks (friendship: -3).

9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This creates a tension of `clashing_emotions` as they are upset about the intrusion, leading to stronger negative emotional links from the Bears towards Goldilocks.

10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair, adding to the tension of an intruder in their house and increasing their negative emotions (friendship: -3).

11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: Finding her asleep introduces both `prisoner` and `clashing_emotions` tensions as they are angry and surprised. This also solidifies their negative emotional links towards her.

12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Startled by the Bears, Goldilocks realizes she's been caught, leading to a `life_at_risk` tension for her safety.

13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window, which resolves some tensions as she frees herself (`prisoner_freed`) but introduces `life_normal` since she might have escaped unharmed.

Now, I need to ensure that each action has at least one postcondition and that they aren't the same as any preconditions. For actions with preconditions like breaking the chair or discovering Goldilocks, their postconditions should resolve or change those tensions accordingly.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nOnce upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.\n\nOne day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.\n\nFirst she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!\n\nThen Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.\n\nNow, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.\n\nBy this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nThen the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nThen the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nUpon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM THROUGH!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nThen the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.\n\nAnd Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"\n\nsaid the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears in bed\nBut when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place! And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!\n\nAnd upon the pillow——?\n\nThere was Goldilocks's yellow head—which was not in its place, for she had no business there.\n\n\"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,—AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"\n\nsaid the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.\n\nNow Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears using the guidelines provided. The user wants me to focus on emotional links (friendship and love) and tensions like character death or risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, or love competition.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a classic tale where Goldilocks trespasses into the Bears' house, eats their porridge, sits in their chairs, sleeps in their bed, and then gets discovered. The story is more about her mischief and the Bears' reaction rather than deep emotional relationships or romantic elements.\n\nSince the user mentioned focusing on actions related to emotional links and tensions, I need to identify any moments where characters show affection, friendship, or love. However, Goldilocks doesn't really interact with the Bears in an emotional way; she's more of a trespasser causing trouble. The Bears themselves seem to be a family unit, but their interactions are minimal beyond reacting to Goldilocks' actions.\n\nLooking at tensions, there's no character death, health risk, or imprisonment. There is some risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and later jumps out the window, which could imply a life-at-risk situation for her. Also, the Bears discover that someone has been in their house, leading to tension as they search for the intruder.\n\nI need to structure each action chronologically, using JSON with keys like action, n_characters, subject, object. Each action should be simple and avoid character names, using snake_case.\n\nLet me break down the story:\n\n1. Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge.\n2. Tastes Middle-sized Bear's porridge.\n3. Eats Little Wee Bear's porridge.\n4. Sits in Great Big Bear's chair.\n5. Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair.\n6. Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair.\n7. Sleeps in Great Big Bear's bed.\n8. Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed.\n9. Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed.\n10. Bears return, find porridge tampered with.\n11. Find chairs disturbed.\n12. Discover Goldilocks asleep.\n13. Goldilocks wakes up, sees Bears, escapes.\n\nNow, for each action, I'll determine the type and whether it relates to emotional links or tensions. Since there's no emotional link beyond the Bears being upset, which is more about tension. The main tensions are life_at_risk when Goldilocks breaks the chair and jumps out the window, and prisoner isn't applicable here.\n\nI also need to check for clashing emotions or love competition, but nothing in the story fits that. So, I'll focus on actions leading to tension, specifically life_at_risk when she falls from the chair and escapes through the window.\n\nEach JSON entry will have an action key with a description, n_characters (how many involved), subject (who did it), object (who it was done to). If there's no subject or object, use '-'.\n\nI think that's about it. Now I'll structure each identified action into the required format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

So, I've got a story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and I need to analyze each action in terms of emotional links and preconditions. The user wants me to identify or infer the emotional links that serve as preconditions for each character's actions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what an emotional link is. There are two types: `friendship` and `love`. Each has a magnitude from -3 to 3. A positive value indicates a stronger bond, while negative suggests dislike or hatred. Preconditions mean that before a character can perform an action, certain emotional links must exist.\n\nLooking at the story, Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears. She's just a curious and naughty girl who happens upon their house. The Bears are a family unit, but there’s no indication of romantic love between them; it's all platonic. So, I'm mainly looking at `friendship` type links here.\n\nNow, let's go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes the Great Big Bear's porridge. Since she doesn't know them, there’s no emotional link here. So, preconditions are empty.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, no prior emotional link; it's just her curiosity or hunger driving this action.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: She sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No emotional link here either; she’s just testing things out.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Same as above, no emotional connection needed.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This might indicate some frustration or recklessness, but that's more about her temperament than an emotional link with the Bears.\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. Again, just exploring, no prior emotional connection.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Same reasoning; it’s about comfort seeking rather than any emotional tie.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. She’s tired from her activities, so no specific emotional link here.\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This is more about the state of the porridge than any emotions towards Goldilocks since they don’t know her yet.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. Again, it's about the state of their belongings, not emotional connections.\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is the first time they interact, so no pre-existing emotional links here.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. She’s startled by the noise, not due to any emotional link with him.\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes because she's scared of being caught, again driven by fear rather than any emotional connection.\n\nThroughout all these actions, there are no instances where an emotional link is a precondition for the action. Goldilocks doesn't have any prior relationship with the Bears, and her actions are driven by curiosity, hunger, tiredness, or fear rather than any emotional bonds. The Bears react to the state of their belongings but don’t exhibit emotions towards Goldilocks until after these actions.\n\nTherefore, all preconditions related to emotional links are empty because there's no existing bond that facilitates these actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": []\n        }\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

There’s no immediate tension here; she's just curious. So, no tensions as preconditions.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. Again, this is more about her hunger or curiosity, not any existing tension.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in the Great Big Bear's chair. No tension here; she’s exploring the house.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Sits in Middle-sized Bear's chair. Similar to above, just testing comfort.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This could introduce a `life_at_risk` or `health_at_risk` tension for Goldilocks because she falls and might get hurt.\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Lies in Great Big Bear's bed. No inherent tension here; it’s about comfort.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Lies in Middle-sized Bear's bed. Again, just seeking comfort.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed. This leads to the Bears finding her later, which could introduce a `prisoner` tension if they decide to detain her.\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This introduces a sense of intrusion or violation, which could lead to `clashing_emotions` as they become upset about their property being disturbed.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair. This adds to the tension of someone being in their house uninvited, possibly leading to `life_at_risk` if they think there's an intruder.\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: The Bears find Goldilocks asleep. This is a key moment where tensions like `prisoner` (if they decide to hold her) or `clashing_emotions` because of their anger and surprise come into play.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Goldilocks wakes up when Little Wee Bear speaks. The noise startles her, leading to tension as she realizes she's been discovered, possibly fearing for her safety (`life_at_risk`).\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window. This action clearly puts her `life_at_risk` because falling from a height could cause injury.\n\nNow, I need to map these tensions as preconditions where applicable. Most of the early actions don't have tension preconditions except for when she breaks the chair and when they discover her, leading to escape and potential harm.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"taste_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"eat_entire_porridge\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_hard_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"sit_in_soft_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"break_chair\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_high_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"lie_in_soft_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": []\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_asleep_in_bed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_porridge_tampering\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"find_chair_broken\",\n        \"n_characters\": 3,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"discover_sleeping_goldilocks\",\n        \"n_characters\": 4,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"clashing_emotions\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wake_up_to_noise\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"escape_through_window\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\",\n        \"preconditions\": {\n            \"emotional_links\": [],\n            \"tensions\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n                    \"from\": \"*\",\n                    \"to\": \"*\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to identify or infer postconditions for each action in this story about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The user wants me to look at changes to emotional links and tensions caused by each action, ensuring that at least one postcondition is required per action and that they aren't the same as preconditions if any existed.\n\nFirst, let's recall what postconditions are: they're changes in emotional links or tensions resulting from an action. Emotional links can be of type `friendship` or `love`, with magnitudes between -3 and 3. Tensions include things like `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, etc., and there are also normal tensions that resolve these.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one to determine the postconditions:\n\n1. **Taste Porridge**: Goldilocks tastes Great Big Bear's porridge. She doesn't like it because it's too hot, so this might create a negative emotional link towards the Bears (friendship: -1). No direct tension is introduced here.\n\n2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: She eats all of Little Wee Bear's porridge. This action shows her disregard for others' property, which could lead to a more negative emotional link (friendship: -2) from the Bears towards Goldilocks when they find out.\n\n3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: Sits in Great Big Bear's chair and finds it too hard. Again, this is just exploration; no significant emotional change here.\n\n4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Finds Middle-sized Bear's chair too soft. Still exploring, so minimal to no change in emotional links.\n\n5. **Break Chair**: Breaks Little Wee Bear's chair. This action introduces a tension of `life_at_risk` for Goldilocks as she falls and could get hurt. It also likely increases negative emotions from the Bears towards her (friendship: -3).\n\n6. **Lie in High Bed**: Finds Great Big Bear's bed too high, so no significant emotional change here.\n\n7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Middle-sized Bear's bed is too soft; still just exploring comfort, so minimal impact on emotional links.\n\n8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: Falls asleep in Little Wee Bear's bed, which leads to the Bears discovering her later. This introduces a tension of `prisoner` as they might detain her and negative emotions towards Goldilocks (friendship: -3).\n\n9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: The Bears notice their porridge has been tasted. This creates a tension of `clashing_emotions` as they are upset about the intrusion, leading to stronger negative emotional links from the Bears towards Goldilocks.\n\n10. **Find Chair Broken**: They find the broken chair, adding to the tension of an intruder in their house and increasing their negative emotions (friendship: -3).\n\n11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: Finding her asleep introduces both `prisoner` and `clashing_emotions` tensions as they are angry and surprised. This also solidifies their negative emotional links towards her.\n\n12. **Wake Up to Noise**: Startled by the Bears, Goldilocks realizes she's been caught, leading to a `life_at_risk` tension for her safety.\n\n13. **Escape Through Window**: She escapes by jumping out the window, which resolves some tensions as she frees herself (`prisoner_freed`) but introduces `life_normal` since she might have escaped unharmed.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that each action has at least one postcondition and that they aren't the same as any preconditions. For actions with preconditions like breaking the chair or discovering Goldilocks, their postconditions should resolve or change those tensions accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n

Alright, I need to ensure logical consistency in each action of the Goldilocks and the Three Bears story based on the given instructions. This involves checking that the number of characters (`n_characters`) matches those referenced in preconditions and postconditions, ensuring that dead characters don't have further emotional connections or tensions, and avoiding any illogical situations.

First, I'll go through each action to verify `n_characters`:

1. **Taste Porridge**: `n_characters` is 2 (Goldilocks and the Great Big Bear). Preconditions and postconditions involve both, so this is consistent.
   
2. **Eat Entire Porridge**: Similarly, `n_characters` is 2, aligning with pre/post conditions involving both characters.

3. **Sit in Hard Chair**: `n_characters` is 2, consistent with both subject and object.

4. **Sit in Soft Chair**: Same as above.

5. **Break Chair**: `n_characters` is 2, matching the action's participants.

6. **Lie in High Bed**: `n_characters` is 2, aligning with both characters involved.

7. **Lie in Soft Bed**: Consistent with `n_characters` being 2.

8. **Fall Asleep in Bed**: `n_characters` is 2, matching the action's participants.

9. **Discover Porridge Tampering**: `n_characters` is 3 (the three Bears), which makes sense as they all notice something wrong.

10. **Find Chair Broken**: `n_characters` is 3, consistent with all Bears discovering the broken chair.

11. **Discover Sleeping Goldilocks**: `n_characters` is 4 (all Bears and Goldilocks), aligning with everyone involved.

12. **Wake Up to Noise**: `n_characters` is 1 (Goldilocks waking up), so only her emotional state is considered.

13. **Escape Through Window**: `n_characters` is 1, focusing solely on Goldilocks' escape.

Next, I'll check for any dead characters continuing to have emotional links or tensions. In this story, no character dies, so this isn't an issue.

I'll ensure that postconditions are different from preconditions and that each action has at least one postcondition. For example:

- **Break Chair** has a precondition of `life_at_risk` and a postcondition of a stronger negative emotional link.
  
- **Escape Through Window** resolves the `prisoner` tension with `prisoner_freed` and ensures Goldilocks' life is back to normal.

I'll also verify that only 'a' and 'b' are used for emotional links and tensions, ensuring 'a' refers to the subject and 'b' to the object. No other IDs should be present.

Finally, I'll check JSON syntax to ensure all keys like `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to` are correctly included without any missing or extra fields.

By systematically reviewing each action, I can ensure that the final JSON is logically consistent and free of errors.
