Story:  JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.
Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. 
Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 
Keep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. 
Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Once, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. 

Here is the story:

Alright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.

I need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.

Let me start by breaking down the story step by step. 

1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.

2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.

3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.

4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.

5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.

6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.

7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.

8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.

9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.

10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.

11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.

12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.

13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.

14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.

I need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.

Wait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.

I should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.

Now, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.

time=2025-04-16T12:23:10.288-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters.

For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.

First, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.

Let me start with the first action: "suffers_injury". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.

Next, "applies_curative_plant" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.

Moving on to "kidnaps", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.

"Ties_to_rock" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.

"Prays" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.

"Searches_for_enemy" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.

"Throws_dust", "attacks_with_dagger", and "takes_heart" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.

"Liberates_prisoner" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.

"Kisses" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.

"Recognizes_tattoo" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.

"Cuts_jugular" and "cuts_throat" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.

I need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved. Also, I should format everything correctly in JSON with the specified keys.

By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.\n\nWait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nLet me start with the first action: \"suffers_injury\". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.\n\nMoving on to \"kidnaps\", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved. Also, I should format everything correctly in JSON with the specified keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

Alright, I'm trying to help this user by analyzing the story they provided. They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.

First, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').

Starting with "suffers_injury": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).

Next, "applies_curative_plant" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.

"Kidnaps" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, "ties_to_rock" continues this prisoner situation.

"Prays" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.

"Searches_for_enemy" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner. So, the tension here is prisoner related.

"Throws_dust", "attacks_with_dagger", and "takes_heart" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions are taken under life_at_risk for both characters involved.

"Liberates_prisoner" addresses the prisoner tension by freeing Princess.

"Kisses" doesn't have a direct tension precondition but follows from resolved tensions, so no specific tension here.

"Recognizes_tattoo" leads to new tensions as Princess's emotions shift, indicating her life might be at risk due to her actions.

"Cuts_jugular" and "cuts_throat" result in character_dead for both Jaguar_Knight and Princess, respectively.

I need to ensure each tension is correctly identified and mapped to the appropriate characters. If a tension involves no specific character or applies generally, I'll use '*' or '-' as needed.

time=2025-04-16T12:24:53.144-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.\n\nWait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nLet me start with the first action: \"suffers_injury\". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.\n\nMoving on to \"kidnaps\", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved. Also, I should format everything correctly in JSON with the specified keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.\n\nFirst, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, \"ties_to_rock\" continues this prisoner situation.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner.

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, I need to help this user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user is interested in narrative analysis, specifically how actions affect emotional links and tensions. They want me to outline what changes occur after each action, ensuring that these are not the same as preconditions.

First, I'll go through each action one by one. For each, I'll consider both emotional_links and tensions postconditions.

Starting with "suffers_injury": This increases health risks for Jaguar_Knight, so a tension of health_at_risk is added. No emotional link changes here since it's an injury without another character involved.

Next, "applies_curative_plant" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action heals him, reducing health_at_risk and possibly creating a positive non-romantic link from Jaguar_Knight to Princess as gratitude.

"Kidnaps" by Enemy on Princess creates a prisoner tension. This might also foster hatred towards the Enemy from Princess, establishing a negative emotional link.

"Ties_to_rock" continues the prisoner tension and reinforces the negative feelings between Enemy and Princess.

"Prays" by Jaguar_Knight doesn't directly affect tensions but shows determination, perhaps improving his own non-romantic emotional link with himself or others.

"Searches_for_enemy" is driven by the desire to free Princess. This action might increase life_at_risk for both Jaguar_Knight and Enemy as they approach confrontation.

"Throws_dust", "attacks_with_dagger", and "takes_heart" all involve combat, increasing life_at_risk tensions. These actions likely create negative emotional links between Jaguar_Knight and Enemy due to the conflict.

"Liberates_prisoner" frees Princess, resolving the prisoner tension and creating a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.

"Kisses" is a romantic action that strengthens the romantic emotional link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.

"Recognizes_tattoo" introduces negative emotions in Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link to hatred.

"Cuts_jugular" results in Jaguar_Knight's death, creating a character_dead tension. This action also leads Princess to self-harm out of grief.

"Cuts_throat" results in Princess's death, another character_dead tension, and ends the story tragically.

I need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the outcome of the action without repeating preconditions. Also, I'll adjust n_characters as needed when both subject and object are involved.

time=2025-04-16T12:25:52.551-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.\n\nWait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nLet me start with the first action: \"suffers_injury\". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.\n\nMoving on to \"kidnaps\", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user by analyzing the story they provided. They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.\n\nFirst, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, \"ties_to_rock\" continues this prisoner situation.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner. So, the tension here is prisoner related.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions are taken under life_at_risk for both characters involved.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" addresses the prisoner tension by freeing Princess.\n\n\"Kisses\" doesn't have a direct tension precondition but follows from resolved tensions, so no specific tension here.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to new tensions as Princess's emotions shift, indicating her life might be at risk due to her actions.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" result in character_dead for both Jaguar_Knight and Princess, respectively.\n\nI need to ensure each tension is correctly identified and mapped to the appropriate characters. If a tension involves no specific character or applies generally, I'll use '*' or '-' as needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, I need to help this user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user is interested in narrative analysis, specifically how actions affect emotional links and tensions. They want me to outline what changes occur after each action, ensuring that these are not the same as preconditions.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each, I'll consider both emotional_links and tensions postconditions.\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": This increases health risks for Jaguar_Knight, so a tension of health_at_risk is added. No emotional link changes here since it's an injury without another character involved.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action heals him, reducing health_at_risk and possibly creating a positive non-romantic link from Jaguar_Knight to Princess as gratitude.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess creates a prisoner tension. This might also foster hatred towards the Enemy from Princess, establishing a negative emotional link.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the prisoner tension and reinforces the negative feelings between Enemy and Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight doesn't directly affect tensions but shows determination, perhaps improving his own non-romantic emotional link with himself or others.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to free Princess. This action might increase life_at_risk for both Jaguar_Knight and Enemy as they approach confrontation.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve combat, increasing life_at_risk tensions. These actions likely create negative emotional links between Jaguar_Knight and Enemy due to the conflict.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" frees Princess, resolving the prisoner tension and creating a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action that strengthens the romantic emotional link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" introduces negative emotions in Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link to hatred.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" results in Jaguar_Knight's death, creating a character_dead tension. This action also leads Princess to self-harm out of grief.\n\n\"Cuts_throat\" results in Princess's death, another character_dead tension, and ends the story tragically.\n\nI need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the outcome of the action without repeating preconditions.

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so I need to help this user by ensuring their JSON is logically consistent. They've provided a narrative with actions, preconditions, and postconditions focusing on emotional links and tensions. My goal is to verify each action for consistency in `n_characters`, proper use of 'a' and 'b', and ensure no dead characters have ongoing links or tensions.

First, I'll go through each action:

1. **suffers_injury**: Only Jaguar_Knight is involved (`n_characters` = 1). No emotional links, just a health_at_risk tension. Looks good.

2. **applies_curative_plant**: Involves Princess and Jaguar_Knight. The postcondition adds a non-romantic link from Jaguar to Princess and resolves health_at_risk. Makes sense.

3. **kidnaps** and **ties_to_rock**: Both involve Enemy and Princess, creating prisoner tension. Also, negative emotional links from Princess to Enemy are added.

4. **prays**: Only Jaguar_Knight involved, creates a non-romantic link to himself. No tensions post action.

5. **searches_for_enemy**: Just Jaguar_Knight, leading to life_at_risk for him and the enemy.

6. **throws_dust**, **attacks_with_dagger**, **takes_heart**: All involve both characters, increasing negative emotional links and life_at_risk tensions.

7. **liberates_prisoner**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner tension and adding a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.

8. **kisses**: Romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight, creating a romantic link.

9. **recognizes_tattoo**: Princess's negative emotions towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link.

10. **cuts_jugular** and **cuts_throat**: Both result in character_dead tensions. No further links after death, which is consistent.

I'll ensure that each action has at least one postcondition, no repeated pre/post conditions, and all keys are correctly formatted without invalid values.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.\n\nWait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nLet me start with the first action: \"suffers_injury\". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.\n\nMoving on to \"kidnaps\", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user by analyzing the story they provided. They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.\n\nFirst, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, \"ties_to_rock\" continues this prisoner situation.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner. So, the tension here is prisoner related.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions are taken under life_at_risk for both characters involved.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" addresses the prisoner tension by freeing Princess.\n\n\"Kisses\" doesn't have a direct tension precondition but follows from resolved tensions, so no specific tension here.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to new tensions as Princess's emotions shift, indicating her life might be at risk due to her actions.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" result in character_dead for both Jaguar_Knight and Princess, respectively.\n\nI need to ensure each tension is correctly identified and mapped to the appropriate characters. If a tension involves no specific character or applies generally, I'll use '*' or '-' as needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, I need to help this user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user is interested in narrative analysis, specifically how actions affect emotional links and tensions. They want me to outline what changes occur after each action, ensuring that these are not the same as preconditions.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each, I'll consider both emotional_links and tensions postconditions.\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": This increases health risks for Jaguar_Knight, so a tension of health_at_risk is added. No emotional link changes here since it's an injury without another character involved.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action heals him, reducing health_at_risk and possibly creating a positive non-romantic link from Jaguar_Knight to Princess as gratitude.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess creates a prisoner tension. This might also foster hatred towards the Enemy from Princess, establishing a negative emotional link.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the prisoner tension and reinforces the negative feelings between Enemy and Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight doesn't directly affect tensions but shows determination, perhaps improving his own non-romantic emotional link with himself or others.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to free Princess. This action might increase life_at_risk for both Jaguar_Knight and Enemy as they approach confrontation.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve combat, increasing life_at_risk tensions. These actions likely create negative emotional links between Jaguar_Knight and Enemy due to the conflict.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" frees Princess, resolving the prisoner tension and creating a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action that strengthens the romantic emotional link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" introduces negative emotions in Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link to hatred.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" results in Jaguar_Knight's death, creating a character_dead tension. This action also leads Princess to self-harm out of grief.\n\n\"Cuts_throat\" results in Princess's death, another character_dead tension, and ends the story tragically.\n\nI need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the outcome of the action without repeating preconditions.

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help this user by ensuring their JSON is logically consistent. They've provided a narrative with actions, preconditions, and postconditions focusing on emotional links and tensions. My goal is to verify each action for consistency in `n_characters`, proper use of 'a' and 'b', and ensure no dead characters have ongoing links or tensions.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action:\n\n1. **suffers_injury**: Only Jaguar_Knight is involved (`n_characters` = 1). No emotional links, just a health_at_risk tension. Looks good.\n\n2. **applies_curative_plant**: Involves Princess and Jaguar_Knight. The postcondition adds a non-romantic link from Jaguar to Princess and resolves health_at_risk. Makes sense.\n\n3. **kidnaps** and **ties_to_rock**: Both involve Enemy and Princess, creating prisoner tension. Also, negative emotional links from Princess to Enemy are added.\n\n4. **prays**: Only Jaguar_Knight involved, creates a non-romantic link to himself. No tensions post action.\n\n5. **searches_for_enemy**: Just Jaguar_Knight, leading to life_at_risk for him and the enemy.\n\n6. **throws_dust**, **attacks_with_dagger**, **takes_heart**: All involve both characters, increasing negative emotional links and life_at_risk tensions.\n\n7. **liberates_prisoner**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner tension and adding a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.\n\n8. **kisses**: Romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight, creating a romantic link.\n\n9. **recognizes_tattoo**: Princess's negative emotions towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link.\n\n10. **cuts_jugular** and **cuts_throat**: Both result in character_dead tensions. No further links after death, which is consistent.\n\nI'll ensure that each action has at least one postcondition, no repeated pre/post conditions, and all keys are correctly formatted without invalid values.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has identified that three actions in their JSON object are missing either a 'subject' or an 'object', which is essential for accurately capturing the narrative's emotional links and tensions.

First, I'll look at each problematic action:

1. **prays**: This action currently only involves Jaguar_Knight as the subject, with no object. However, since praying is typically directed towards someone or something (like a deity), it makes sense to introduce an 'object' here. But since the user's focus is on inter-character emotional links, and there’s no specific character involved, I might need to adjust this action.

2. **searches_for_enemy**: This action involves Jaguar_Knight searching for Enemy. The current setup only has Jaguar_Knight as the subject. To accurately reflect the search, both 'subject' (Jaguar_Knight) and 'object' (Enemy) should be included, making 'n_characters' = 2.

3. **recognizes_tattoo**: This action is performed by Princess, recognizing a tattoo on Jaguar_Knight. Therefore, both 'subject' (Princess) and 'object' (Jaguar_Knight) need to be specified, updating 'n_characters' to 2.

Now, I'll go through each action one by one to correct these issues:

- **prays**: Since there's no direct character involved in the prayer besides Jaguar_Knight, it might not require an object. However, for consistency and to avoid missing data, if we consider that Jaguar_Knight is praying to a deity (even if not specified), we could set 'object' to a placeholder like "deity". But since the user's focus is on inter-character links, perhaps it's better to remove any problematic emotional links if no direct object can be reasonably inferred.

- **searches_for_enemy**: This action clearly involves two characters: Jaguar_Knight searching for Enemy. So, 'subject' should be Jaguar_Knight and 'object' should be Enemy, making 'n_characters' = 2.

- **recognizes_tattoo**: Princess is recognizing a tattoo on Jaguar_Knight, so both 'subject' (Princess) and 'object' (Jaguar_Knight) are necessary. Therefore, 'n_characters' should be updated to 2.

After considering these points, I'll adjust the JSON accordingly:

- For "prays", since there's no direct character object besides Jaguar_Knight, I might decide to remove any emotional links if they don't make sense without an object.
  
- For "searches_for_enemy" and "recognizes_tattoo", I'll update 'subject', 'object', and 'n_characters' to reflect the involvement of both characters.

Finally, I'll ensure that all other actions are consistent and that no emotional links or tensions reference missing subjects or objects.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `non-romantic` and `romantic`. `non-romantic` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic (non-romatnic) sense. Most emotional links between characters that are not in a relationship will be of this type. The `romantic` emotional link type refers to a type of romantic love between the characters. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. \nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \nKeep the `action` values simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. Only include actions where the `subject` and `object` refer to characters and not inanimate objects. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nOnce, the JSON object is created verify that the actions accurately reflect events described in the story. \n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis of the actions focusing on emotional links and tensions. They mentioned that they are a narrative analysis expert, so they probably need this for some academic or storytelling purpose.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the story carefully. It's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess living in Tenochtitlan. There's a storm caused by Tlaloc, which damages a bridge. Jaguar_Knight gets injured when trying to cross, and Princess saves him with a curative plant. Then, there's revenge from an enemy who kidnapped Princess. Jaguar_Knight rescues her, they fall in love, but then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nI need to identify the actions that relate to emotional links (non-romantic and romantic) and tensions like character_dead, life_at_risk, etc. The user wants these actions organized in JSON format with specific keys: action, n_characters, subject, object.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the story step by step. \n\n1. **Storm Damages Bridge**: This is a key event causing tension (life_at_risk). So, I'll note 'storm' as an action but wait—the user said to focus on actions involving characters, so maybe not include this since it's a natural event.\n\n2. **Jaguar_Knight Injured**: He tries to cross the bridge and gets hurt. This is life_at_risk, so the action would be 'suffers_injury' with subject as Jaguar_Knight and no object because it's self-inflicted or caused by an event.\n\n3. **Princess Saves Him**: She uses a curative plant, which shows her care (non-romantic emotional link). The action is 'applies_curative_plant', n_characters=2, subject Princess, object Jaguar_Knight.\n\n4. **Jaguar_Knight Recuperates**: This reduces tension but doesn't involve another character, so maybe not an action per the guidelines.\n\n5. **Enemy Kidnaps Princess**: This introduces prisoner and life_at_risk tensions. Action 'kidnaps' with subject Enemy, object Princess.\n\n6. **Princess Tied Up**: Another action by Enemy, increasing tension. Action 'ties_to_rock'.\n\n7. **Jaguar_Knight's Prayer**: He seeks help, showing determination (non-romantic link). Action 'prays', n_characters=1.\n\n8. **Enemy Attacks Princess**: Life_at_risk again. Action 'attacks', but since it's just charging, maybe not, as per the user's note to avoid specific actions without both subject and object.\n\n9. **Jaguar_Knight Searches for Enemy**: Determination again, action 'searches_for_enemy'.\n\n10. **Fights Enemy**: Actions include throwing dust, attacking with dagger, taking heart—each of these is an action involving two characters. So, 'throws_dust', 'attacks_with_dagger', 'takes_heart'.\n\n11. **Liberates Princess**: Shows bravery and romantic feelings. Action 'liberates_prisoner' (but the user prefers terms like 'liberates'), n_characters=2.\n\n12. **Romantic Kiss**: Romantic emotional link, action 'kisses'.\n\n13. **Princess Recognizes Tattoo**: This introduces conflict, changing her emotions from love to hatred. So, action 'recognizes_tattoo', subject Princess.\n\n14. **Princess Kills Jaguar_Knight and Herself**: These are tragic events leading to character_dead tension. Actions 'cuts_jugular' and 'cuts_throat'.\n\nI need to ensure each action is in snake_case, without character names, and that n_characters reflects the number of involved characters. Also, I should only include actions where both subject and object (if applicable) are characters.\n\nWait, some actions might not fit because they involve objects or natural events. For example, 'storm' doesn't have a character subject, so it's excluded. Similarly, tying to a rock is done by Enemy on Princess, so that's included as 'ties_to_rock'.\n\nI should also check the order of events in the story and ensure the JSON follows that sequence.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the JSON structure with each action and their respective keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `non-romantic` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `non-romantic` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nEmotional links must have a source character and a destination character like nodes in a directed graph. If the action calls for an emotional link but either the `subject` or `object` values are currently '-', set the `subject` or `object` to the appropriate character name and update `n_characters`. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who has provided a story and wants an analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions within the narrative. From what I understand, they want me to identify preconditions for each action in terms of emotional links between characters.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each action listed in the JSON and determine if there's an emotional link that serves as a precondition for that action. Emotional links can be either 'non-romantic' or 'romantic', and they have a magnitude from -3 to 3.\n\nLet me start with the first action: \"suffers_injury\". The subject is Jaguar_Knight, and there's no object involved. Since this action doesn't involve another character, I don't think there's an emotional link here. So, the preconditions for this action would have an empty array for emotional_links.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" involves Princess (subject) helping Jaguar_Knight (object). This suggests a positive non-romantic emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight. The magnitude might be around 2 since she goes out of her way to save him.\n\nMoving on to \"kidnaps\", the subject is Enemy and the object is Princess. Kidnapping usually stems from negative emotions, so I'd infer a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -3 (hatred) from Enemy to Princess.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the previous action, so the emotional link here would be consistent: Enemy's hatred towards Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" is Jaguar_Knight praying for help. This suggests he has a positive non-romantic link towards himself or perhaps towards the gods, but since we're focusing on inter-character links, maybe this action doesn't have an applicable precondition related to emotional links between characters.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" implies that Jaguar_Knight is determined to rescue Princess, showing a strong positive non-romantic link towards her. The magnitude here could be 3, indicating a very strong bond or determination.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions likely stem from anger or hatred towards Enemy, so a non-romantic link with a magnitude of -2 to -3 from Jaguar_Knight to Enemy makes sense here.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" is Jaguar_Knight freeing Princess, which again shows his positive feelings towards her. This would be a non-romantic link with a high magnitude, maybe 3.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight. Here, the emotional link would be romantic with a magnitude of 3, indicating deep affection.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to Princess feeling hatred towards Jaguar_Knight because of his association with her father's murderers. This introduces a non-romantic link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight with a magnitude of -3.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" are tragic actions resulting from the intense negative emotions Princess now feels towards Jaguar_Knight and herself. These would have preconditions of strong negative emotional links.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition is accurately inferred based on the story's context and that the magnitudes reflect the intensity of the emotions involved. Also, I should format everything correctly in JSON with the specified keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -2,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": 3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"emotional_links\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"non-romantic\",\n          \"magnitude\": -3,\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions.

They want me to identify preconditions related to tensions for each action in their narrative. The user is likely a narrative analysis expert or someone studying storytelling structures, so they need this information to understand how tensions drive character actions.\n\nFirst, I'll review each action and determine if any of the defined tension types (character_dead, life_at_risk, health_at_risk, prisoner) are preconditions for that action. Tensions can involve specific characters or be more general, affecting anyone ('*') or no one('-').\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": Jaguar_Knight is injured, which puts his health at risk. So, the tension here is health_at_risk from 'a' (Jaguar_Knight) to 'b' (himself).\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action is taken because his health was at risk, so the precondition is health_at_risk.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess introduces a prisoner tension, as she's being held captive. Similarly, \"ties_to_rock\" continues this prisoner situation.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight likely stems from the ongoing tensions like life_at_risk for himself or others, so I'll infer that as a precondition.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to rescue Princess, who's a prisoner. So, the tension here is prisoner related.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve Jaguar_Knight confronting Enemy. These actions are taken under life_at_risk for both characters involved.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" addresses the prisoner tension by freeing Princess.\n\n\"Kisses\" doesn't have a direct tension precondition but follows from resolved tensions, so no specific tension here.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" leads to new tensions as Princess's emotions shift, indicating her life might be at risk due to her actions.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" and \"cuts_throat\" result in character_dead for both Jaguar_Knight and Princess, respectively.\n\nI need to ensure each tension is correctly identified and mapped to the appropriate characters. If a tension involves no specific character or applies generally, I'll use '*' or '-' as needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"applies_curative_plant\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"health_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kidnaps\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"ties_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"prays\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"searches_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"throws_dust\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"attacks_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"takes_heart\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Enemy\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"liberates_prisoner\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"Princess\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"prisoner\",\n          \"from\": \"b\",\n          \"to\": \"a\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"kisses\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": []\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"recognizes_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"life_at_risk\",\n          \"from\": \"*\",\n          \"to\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"cuts_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n      \"tensions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"character_dead\",\n          \"from\": \"a\",\n          \"to\": \"b\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nCheck to make sure the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately for each action. If an action has an emotional link, both the `subject` and `object` values must be set to the appropriate character name and `n_characters` must be updated to reflect that change. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜>\nOkay, I need to help this user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user is interested in narrative analysis, specifically how actions affect emotional links and tensions. They want me to outline what changes occur after each action, ensuring that these are not the same as preconditions.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each action one by one. For each, I'll consider both emotional_links and tensions postconditions.\n\nStarting with \"suffers_injury\": This increases health risks for Jaguar_Knight, so a tension of health_at_risk is added. No emotional link changes here since it's an injury without another character involved.\n\nNext, \"applies_curative_plant\" by Princess on Jaguar_Knight. This action heals him, reducing health_at_risk and possibly creating a positive non-romantic link from Jaguar_Knight to Princess as gratitude.\n\n\"Kidnaps\" by Enemy on Princess creates a prisoner tension. This might also foster hatred towards the Enemy from Princess, establishing a negative emotional link.\n\n\"Ties_to_rock\" continues the prisoner tension and reinforces the negative feelings between Enemy and Princess.\n\n\"Prays\" by Jaguar_Knight doesn't directly affect tensions but shows determination, perhaps improving his own non-romantic emotional link with himself or others.\n\n\"Searches_for_enemy\" is driven by the desire to free Princess. This action might increase life_at_risk for both Jaguar_Knight and Enemy as they approach confrontation.\n\n\"Throws_dust\", \"attacks_with_dagger\", and \"takes_heart\" all involve combat, increasing life_at_risk tensions. These actions likely create negative emotional links between Jaguar_Knight and Enemy due to the conflict.\n\n\"Liberates_prisoner\" frees Princess, resolving the prisoner tension and creating a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Kisses\" is a romantic action that strengthens the romantic emotional link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n\n\"Recognizes_tattoo\" introduces negative emotions in Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link to hatred.\n\n\"Cuts_jugular\" results in Jaguar_Knight's death, creating a character_dead tension. This action also leads Princess to self-harm out of grief.\n\n\"Cuts_throat\" results in Princess's death, another character_dead tension, and ends the story tragically.\n\nI need to ensure each postcondition accurately reflects the outcome of the action without repeating preconditions. Also, I'll adjust n_characters as needed when both subject and object are involved.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\":

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \nEach action must have at least one postcondition. If a postcondition (an effect of the action) cannot be identified or easily inferred, remove the action from the JSON object.\nCheck the syntax of the JSON object. Make sure all of the expected keys are present. Each emotional link should have keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`. Each tension should have keys `type`, `from`, and `to`. Make sure the all number values are valid JSON. Positive numbers should be written without the `+` prefix.\nVerify that the `subject` and `object` values are set appropriately. If there is an emotional link present in an action, both `subject` and `object` must be set to the correct character names and `n_characters` should be correct. If an action has an emotional link, '-' should not be the `subject` or `object` values. If there are no reasobable direct or indirect values to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the action.\nMake sure the emotional link types are correct. 'non-romantic' refers to normal platonic feelings while 'romantic' refers to romantic love.\nCheck that the `action` values are simple and focused on the abstract action being performed rather than a specific character performing the action. For example, if Goldilocks eats Baby Bear's porridge, label the action as 'eats_porridge' with 'Goldilocks' as the subject and 'Baby Bear' as the indirect object rather than labeling the action as 'goldilocks_eats_baby_bear_porridge'. \nReturn this verfied and correct JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help this user by ensuring their JSON is logically consistent.

No tensions post action.\n\n5. **searches_for_enemy**: Just Jaguar_Knight, leading to life_at_risk for him and the enemy.\n\n6. **throws_dust**, **attacks_with_dagger**, **takes_heart**: All involve both characters, increasing negative emotional links and life_at_risk tensions.\n\n7. **liberates_prisoner**: Frees Princess, resolving prisoner tension and adding a positive non-romantic link from her to Jaguar_Knight.\n\n8. **kisses**: Romantic action between Princess and Jaguar_Knight, creating a romantic link.\n\n9. **recognizes_tattoo**: Princess's negative emotions towards Jaguar_Knight, changing their emotional link.\n\n10. **cuts_jugular** and **cuts_throat**: Both result in character_dead tensions.

emotional links but are missing a `subject` or `object`: \n\n['prays', 'searches_for_enemy', 'recognizes_tattoo'].\n Please regenerate the JSON object to include the correct `subject` or `object` values for these actions and update `n_characters` appropriately. If after review, there are no reasonable direct or indirect objects to set `object`, remove the problematic emotional links from the JSON object. Make sure to wrap the JSON object in ```json``` tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has identified that three actions in their JSON object are missing either a 'subject' or an 'object', which is essential for accurately capturing the narrative's emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each problematic action:\n\n1. **prays**: This action currently only involves Jaguar_Knight as the subject, with no object. However, since praying is typically directed towards someone or something (like a deity), it makes sense to introduce an 'object' here. But since the user's focus is on inter-character emotional links, and there’s no specific character involved, I might need to adjust this action.\n\n2. **searches_for_enemy**: This action involves Jaguar_Knight searching for Enemy. The current setup only has Jaguar_Knight as the subject. To accurately reflect the search, both 'subject' (Jaguar_Knight) and 'object' (Enemy) should be included, making 'n_characters' = 2.\n\n3. **recognizes_tattoo**: This action is performed by Princess, recognizing a tattoo on Jaguar_Knight. Therefore, both 'subject' (Princess) and 'object' (Jaguar_Knight) need to be specified, updating 'n_characters' to 2.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one to correct these issues:\n\n- **prays**: Since there's no direct character involved in the prayer besides Jaguar_Knight, it might not require an object. However, for consistency and to avoid missing data, if we consider that Jaguar_Knight is praying to a deity (even if not specified), we could set 'object' to a placeholder like \"deity\". But since the user's focus is on inter-character links, perhaps it's better to remove any problematic emotional links if no direct object can be reasonably inferred.\n\n- **searches_for_enemy**: This action clearly involves two characters: Jaguar_Knight searching for Enemy. So, 'subject' should be Jaguar_Knight and 'object' should be Enemy, making 'n_characters' = 2.\n\n- **recognizes_tattoo**: Princess is recognizing a tattoo on Jaguar_Knight, so both 'subject' (Princess) and 'object' (Jaguar_Knight) are necessary. Therefore, 'n_characters' should be updated to 2.\n\nAfter considering these points, I'll adjust the JSON accordingly:\n\n- For \"prays\", since there's no direct character object besides Jaguar_Knight, I might decide to remove any emotional links if they don't make sense without an object.\n  \n- For \"searches_for_enemy\" and \"recognizes_tattoo\", I'll update 'subject', 'object', and 'n_characters' to reflect the involvement of both characters.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that all other actions are consistent and that no emotional links or tensions reference missing subjects or objects.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"suffers_injury\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"Jaguar_Knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\",\n    \"preconditions\": {\n

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has encountered an error when extracting data from their JSON object, specifically mentioning an issue with the key `'from'`. My goal is to identify why this error occurred and correct the JSON accordingly.

First, I'll examine the provided JSON to locate where the error might be happening. The error message points to the key `'from'`, which suggests that there's either a missing value or an invalid entry associated with this key in one of the actions.

I'll go through each action in the JSON:

1. **suffers_injury**: This action only involves Jaguar_Knight, so no 'from' or 'to' keys are used here. No issue.

2. **applies_curative_plant**: The emotional link has 'from': "Jaguar_Knight" and 'to': "Princess". Both are valid character names. No problem here.

3. **kidnaps**: Emotional link from Enemy to Princess is correctly set.

4. **ties_to_rock**: Similar setup as kidnaps, no issues.

5. **prays**: This action previously had emotional links but they were removed due to missing 'object'. Now it has empty emotional_links and tensions. No 'from' key here, so this isn't the source of the error.

6. **searches_for_enemy**: Emotional links are set with 'from': "a" and 'to': "b". Wait, earlier corrections changed 'subject' and 'object' to specific characters, but in some places, they might still be using 'a' and 'b'.

7. **throws_dust**, **attacks_with_dagger**, **takes_heart**: These actions involve both Jaguar_Knight and Enemy, with emotional links set appropriately.

8. **liberates_prisoner**: Correctly references Princess and Jaguar_Knight.

9. **kisses**: Romantic link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight is fine.

10. **recognizes_tattoo**: Emotional link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight is correct.

11. **cuts_jugular** and **cuts_throat**: Both have emotional links set with valid 'from' and 'to'.

Upon closer inspection, the issue likely stems from actions where 'a' or 'b' are used instead of actual character names in emotional links or tensions. For example, in "searches_for_enemy", the postconditions still use 'a' and 'b', which might not be valid references.

To fix this, I'll ensure that all 'from' and 'to' values in emotional_links and tensions reference specific character names instead of 'a' or 'b'. Additionally, I'll verify that all keys are correctly formatted without any typos or missing values.

Finally, I'll regenerate the JSON object with these corrections to prevent any further errors during data extraction.
