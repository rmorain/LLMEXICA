<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, from what I remember, the sun usually rises in the east and sets in the west. But wait, is that always the case everywhere on Earth?

I think it has something to do with the Earth's rotation. The Earth spins from west to east, which makes the sun appear to rise in the east. So generally, no, the sun doesn't rise in the west. But maybe there are exceptions? Like near the poles or something.

At the North Pole, I believe the sun can stay up for months during summer and then not rise at all during winter. So maybe around the equinoxes or solstices, the direction of sunrise might change slightly. But does it ever actually rise in the west?

I don't think so. Even if you're near the poles, the sun's path is such that when it does rise, it's still from the east. Maybe during some rare atmospheric conditions, like refraction or something, it could look different, but I'm not sure.

Wait, there are places where the sun appears to rise in the west due to optical illusions or unique geography, but that's not the actual direction, right? It's just how it looks from a certain perspective. So the answer is probably no.

No

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions in a story. The goal is to extract actions from the main characters related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.

First, I need to understand the specific types of emotional links: friendship and love. Then, the tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition. 

Looking at the story provided, it's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I'll need to go through each event in order.

I'll start by identifying key actions that affect their emotional relationships or build tension. For example, when the bridge collapses, injuring Jaguar_Knight, that's a health risk. Princess's action of healing him builds a positive emotional link, probably friendship turning into love later.

Then, there's the revenge plot where Enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces life-at-risk and prisoner tensions. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.

The twist comes when Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. The subsequent violence leads to both their deaths, which are character_dead postconditions.

I need to structure these actions in chronological order, ensuring each JSON entry includes the number of characters involved and who is subject or object. I'll avoid using character names, so the actions can be reused. Each action should be brief and in snake_case.

Finally, after extracting all relevant actions, I'll map them into the specified JSON format with appropriate keys. Making sure that the n_characters aligns with whether there's a subject and object.

time=2025-04-09T14:38:55.840-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions in a story. The goal is to extract actions from the main characters related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the specific types of emotional links: friendship and love. Then, the tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition. \n\nLooking at the story provided, it's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I'll need to go through each event in order.\n\nI'll start by identifying key actions that affect their emotional relationships or build tension. For example, when the bridge collapses, injuring Jaguar_Knight, that's a health risk. Princess's action of healing him builds a positive emotional link, probably friendship turning into love later.\n\nThen, there's the revenge plot where Enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces life-at-risk and prisoner tensions.

Alright, so I need to convert this JSON structure into something called the Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) format. Let me first understand what DPS is based on the example provided.

From the example, it looks like a story starts with "Sto" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action line has a subject, an action, and sometimes an object. If there's no subject or object, they are just omitted from the line.

Looking at the JSON data provided earlier, I see that each action is in snake_case, like "bridge_collapses", and includes the number of characters involved as well as who is the subject and object (if any). My goal is to map these JSON actions into the DPS format by creating lines where each line represents an action with its subject and object.

First, I need to ensure that the character names match exactly between the JSON and what will be in the DPS. In the JSON, characters like "JAGUAR_KNIGHT", "PRINCESS", and "ENEMY" are mentioned. These should be used as-is in the DPS.

Next, for each action in the JSON array, I need to create a corresponding line in the DPS format. For example, if an action is "bridge_collapses" with no subject or object, it would simply be "bridge_collapses". If there's a subject and an object, like "PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT", then that would translate to "PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT".

I also need to maintain the chronological order of actions as they appear in the JSON. This ensures that the story unfolds correctly in the DPS format.

One thing I need to watch out for is ensuring that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly by omitting them, not leaving any empty spaces that could be misinterpreted.

After mapping all actions, I'll wrap the entire sequence within <DPS> tags as requested.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions in a story. The goal is to extract actions from the main characters related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the specific types of emotional links: friendship and love. Then, the tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition. \n\nLooking at the story provided, it's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I'll need to go through each event in order.\n\nI'll start by identifying key actions that affect their emotional relationships or build tension. For example, when the bridge collapses, injuring Jaguar_Knight, that's a health risk. Princess's action of healing him builds a positive emotional link, probably friendship turning into love later.\n\nThen, there's the revenge plot where Enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces life-at-risk and prisoner tensions. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n\nThe twist comes when Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. The subsequent violence leads to both their deaths, which are character_dead postconditions.\n\nI need to structure these actions in chronological order, ensuring each JSON entry includes the number of characters involved and who is subject or object.

<think>
Alright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. The idea is that for certain actions to make sense, characters must have specific emotional links towards each other beforehand.

First, I'll list out all the actions:

1. bridge_collapses
2. character_injured
3. character_healed
4. character_kidnapped
5. character_tied_up
6. character_prays
7. character_searched_for
8. character_attacked
9. dust_thrown_in_face
10. character_stabbed
11. heart_taken_as_offer
12. character_freed
13. characters_kiss
14. tattoo_recognized
15. character_feels_ambivalence
16. character_jugular_cut
17. character_throat_cut

Now, I'll go through each action one by one and determine if there are any emotional links that must exist as preconditions for the action to make sense.

1. **bridge_collapses**: This is an event that happens due to external circumstances (the storm), so no emotional link is required here.

2. **character_injured**: Similar to the bridge collapsing, this is a result of the accident, not dependent on any emotional state.

3. **character_healed (PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: For PRINCESS to heal JAGUAR_KNIGHT, it's reasonable to assume that she must have a positive emotional link towards him, likely friendship or love. Given the context, maybe a moderate positive magnitude like 2.

4. **character_kidnapped (ENEMY kidnapped PRINCESS)**: For ENEMY to kidnap PRINCESS, there might be some negative emotion, possibly hatred towards her. So a negative emotional link from ENEMY to PRINCESS with magnitude -3.

5. **character_tied_up (ENEMY tied_up PRINCESS)**: This follows the kidnapping, so similar negative emotions as above apply.

6. **character_prays (JAGUAR_KNIGHT prayed)**: Praying might be driven by concern or care for someone else, suggesting a positive emotional link towards that person.

7. **character_searched_for (JAGUAR_KNIGHT searched_for ENEMY)**: Searching for someone could stem from various emotions, but in this context, it's likely due to the desire to rescue PRINCESS, indicating a positive link towards her and possibly negative towards ENEMY.

8. **character_attacked (JAGUAR_KNIGHT attacked ENEMY)**: Attacking usually involves some negative emotion like anger or hatred towards the target.

9. **dust_thrown_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT threw_dust_in_face ENEMY)**: Similar to attacking, this action would be driven by negative emotions towards ENEMY.

10. **character_stabbed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT stabbed ENEMY)**: Stabbing is a violent act and definitely involves strong negative emotions like hatred.

11. **heart_taken_as_offer (JAGUAR_KNIGHT took_heart_from ENEMY)**: Taking someone's heart as an offering suggests deep-seated anger or revenge, indicating a very negative emotional link.

12. **character_freed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT freed PRINCESS)**: Freeing someone typically involves positive emotions like care or love towards them.

13. **characters_kiss (PRINCESS kissed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Kissing is a clear sign of romantic love, so a strong positive emotional link here.

14. **tattoo_recognized (PRINCESS recognized_tattoo)**: Recognizing a tattoo linked to past trauma might evoke fear or hatred towards the person with the tattoo.

15. **character_feels_ambivalence (PRINCESS felt_ambivalence)**: Ambivalence implies conflicting emotions, possibly love and hatred, indicating both positive and negative links.

16. **character_jugular_cut (PRINCESS cut_jugular JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Cutting someone's jugular is an extreme act of violence, suggesting intense negative emotions like hatred or betrayal.

17. **character_throat_cut (PRINCESS cut_throat)**: Cutting one's own throat indicates profound emotional distress or despair, possibly stemming from complex emotional states towards oneself or others.

For each action where I identified emotional links, I'll structure the preconditions accordingly. For actions without clear emotional prerequisites, I'll leave the `emotional_links` array empty.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to act as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions in a story. The goal is to extract actions from the main characters related to these elements and organize them into a JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the specific types of emotional links: friendship and love. Then, the tensions include things like character death, life at risk, health issues, imprisonment, clashing emotions, and love competition. \n\nLooking at the story provided, it's about Jaguar_Knight and Princess dealing with various conflicts and emotional shifts. I'll need to go through each event in order.\n\nI'll start by identifying key actions that affect their emotional relationships or build tension. For example, when the bridge collapses, injuring Jaguar_Knight, that's a health risk. Princess's action of healing him builds a positive emotional link, probably friendship turning into love later.\n\nThen, there's the revenge plot where Enemy kidnaps Princess, which introduces life-at-risk and prisoner tensions. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing bravery and strengthening their bond.\n\nThe twist comes when Princess recognizes Jaguar_Knight's tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. The subsequent violence leads to both their deaths, which are character_dead postconditions.\n\nI need to structure these actions in chronological order, ensuring each JSON entry includes the number of characters involved and who is subject or object. I'll avoid using character names, so the actions can be reused. Each action should be brief and in snake_case.\n\nFinally, after extracting all relevant actions, I'll map them into the specified JSON format with appropriate keys. Making sure that the n_characters aligns with whether there's a subject and object.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"bridge_collapses\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_healed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_kidnapped\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n        \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_tied_up\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"ENEMY\",\n        \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_prays\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_searched_for\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_attacked\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"dust_thrown_in_face\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_stabbed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"heart_taken_as_offer\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"ENEMY\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_freed\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\",\n        \"object\": \"PRINCESS\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"characters_kiss\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"tattoo_recognized\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_feels_ambivalence\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_jugular_cut\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"character_throat_cut\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"PRINCESS\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\nThe story begins with the string \"Sto\" and is then followed by a sequence of actions. The sequence of actions always follows the form of `subject` `action` `object` where `subject` is the character performing the action and `object` is the character receiving the action. \n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to convert this JSON structure into something called the Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) format. Let me first understand what DPS is based on the example provided.\n\nFrom the example, it looks like a story starts with \"Sto\" followed by a sequence of actions. Each action line has a subject, an action, and sometimes an object. If there's no subject or object, they are just omitted from the line.\n\nLooking at the JSON data provided earlier, I see that each action is in snake_case, like \"bridge_collapses\", and includes the number of characters involved as well as who is the subject and object (if any). My goal is to map these JSON actions into the DPS format by creating lines where each line represents an action with its subject and object.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the character names match exactly between the JSON and what will be in the DPS. In the JSON, characters like \"JAGUAR_KNIGHT\", \"PRINCESS\", and \"ENEMY\" are mentioned. These should be used as-is in the DPS.\n\nNext, for each action in the JSON array, I need to create a corresponding line in the DPS format. For example, if an action is \"bridge_collapses\" with no subject or object, it would simply be \"bridge_collapses\". If there's a subject and an object, like \"PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT\", then that would translate to \"PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT\".\n\nI also need to maintain the chronological order of actions as they appear in the JSON. This ensures that the story unfolds correctly in the DPS format.\n\nOne thing I need to watch out for is ensuring that actions without subjects or objects are represented correctly by omitting them, not leaving any empty spaces that could be misinterpreted.\n\nAfter mapping all actions, I'll wrap the entire sequence within <DPS> tags as requested.\n</think>\n\n<DPS>\nSto\nbridge_collapses -\ncharacter_injured -\nPRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT\nENEMY kidnapped PRINCESS\nENEMY tied_up PRINCESS\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT prayed -\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT searched_for ENEMY\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT attacked ENEMY\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT threw_dust_in_face ENEMY\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT stabbed ENEMY\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT took_heart_from ENEMY\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT freed PRINCESS\nPRINCESS kissed JAGUAR_KNIGHT\nPRINCESS recognized_tattoo -\nPRINCESS felt_ambivalence -\nPRINCESS cut_jugular JAGUAR_KNIGHT\nPRINCESS cut_throat -\n</DPS><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify any preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', and they have a magnitude between -3 and 3. The idea is that for certain actions to make sense, characters must have specific emotional links towards each other beforehand.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the actions:\n\n1. bridge_collapses\n2. character_injured\n3. character_healed\n4. character_kidnapped\n5. character_tied_up\n6. character_prays\n7. character_searched_for\n8. character_attacked\n9. dust_thrown_in_face\n10. character_stabbed\n11. heart_taken_as_offer\n12. character_freed\n13. characters_kiss\n14. tattoo_recognized\n15. character_feels_ambivalence\n16. character_jugular_cut\n17. character_throat_cut\n\nNow, I'll go through each action one by one and determine if there are any emotional links that must exist as preconditions for the action to make sense.\n\n1. **bridge_collapses**: This is an event that happens due to external circumstances (the storm), so no emotional link is required here.\n\n2. **character_injured**: Similar to the bridge collapsing, this is a result of the accident, not dependent on any emotional state.\n\n3. **character_healed (PRINCESS healed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: For PRINCESS to heal JAGUAR_KNIGHT, it's reasonable to assume that she must have a positive emotional link towards him, likely friendship or love. Given the context, maybe a moderate positive magnitude like 2.\n\n4. **character_kidnapped (ENEMY kidnapped PRINCESS)**: For ENEMY to kidnap PRINCESS, there might be some negative emotion, possibly hatred towards her. So a negative emotional link from ENEMY to PRINCESS with magnitude -3.\n\n5. **character_tied_up (ENEMY tied_up PRINCESS)**: This follows the kidnapping, so similar negative emotions as above apply.\n\n6. **character_prays (JAGUAR_KNIGHT prayed)**: Praying might be driven by concern or care for someone else, suggesting a positive emotional link towards that person.\n\n7. **character_searched_for (JAGUAR_KNIGHT searched_for ENEMY)**: Searching for someone could stem from various emotions, but in this context, it's likely due to the desire to rescue PRINCESS, indicating a positive link towards her and possibly negative towards ENEMY.\n\n8. **character_attacked (JAGUAR_KNIGHT attacked ENEMY)**: Attacking usually involves some negative emotion like anger or hatred towards the target.\n\n9. **dust_thrown_in_face (JAGUAR_KNIGHT threw_dust_in_face ENEMY)**: Similar to attacking, this action would be driven by negative emotions towards ENEMY.\n\n10. **character_stabbed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT stabbed ENEMY)**: Stabbing is a violent act and definitely involves strong negative emotions like hatred.\n\n11. **heart_taken_as_offer (JAGUAR_KNIGHT took_heart_from ENEMY)**: Taking someone's heart as an offering suggests deep-seated anger or revenge, indicating a very negative emotional link.\n\n12. **character_freed (JAGUAR_KNIGHT freed PRINCESS)**: Freeing someone typically involves positive emotions like care or love towards them.\n\n13. **characters_kiss (PRINCESS kissed JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Kissing is a clear sign of romantic love, so a strong positive emotional link here.\n\n14. **tattoo_recognized (PRINCESS recognized_tattoo)**: Recognizing a tattoo linked to past trauma might evoke fear or hatred towards the person with the tattoo.\n\n15. **character_feels_ambivalence (PRINCESS felt_ambivalence)**: Ambivalence implies conflicting emotions, possibly love and hatred, indicating both positive and negative links.\n\n16. **character_jugular_cut (PRINCESS cut_jugular JAGUAR_KNIGHT)**: Cutting someone's jugular is an extreme act of violence, suggesting intense negative emotions like hatred or betrayal.\n\n17. **character_throat_cut (PRINCESS cut_throat)**: Cutting one's own throat indicates profound emotional distress or despair, possibly stemming from complex emotional states towards oneself or others.\n\nFor each action where I identified emotional links, I'll structure the preconditions accordingly. For actions without clear emotional prerequisites, I'll leave the `emotional_links` array empty.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON with preconditions related to emotional links:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n
