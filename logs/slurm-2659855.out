Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, I know that generally, we say the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But wait, is that always the case?

Well, from what I remember, the Earth rotates from west to east, which makes the sun appear to rise in the east. So, under normal circumstances, no, the sun doesn't rise in the west. But maybe there are some exceptions or special cases where it could seem like the sun is rising in the west.

I've heard about something called a "sunset sunrise" near the poles during certain times of the year. In places like the Arctic or Antarctica, the sun can stay below the horizon for months and then appear again, which might make it seem like it's rising in the west. But I think that's more about the direction from which it returns rather than a true westward rise.

Also, there could be optical illusions or mirages where the sun appears to be in a different position due to atmospheric conditions. Maybe on some days, because of refraction or clouds, it looks like the sun is rising from the west, but that's not the actual direction.

Another thought: during an eclipse, the sun might appear differently, but I don't think that affects its rising direction. Or maybe if you're moving very fast towards the east, like in a plane flying around the Earth, could it make the sun rise in the west? That seems more like a relative motion effect rather than an actual change in the sun's position.

Wait, there's also the idea of the Earth's rotation and how different latitudes experience sunrise at different times. But that doesn't change the east-west direction, just the time of day. So even near the poles, the sun still rises in the east but maybe sets in a more northerly or southerly direction.

I think I'm confusing some concepts here. Let me try to break it down:

1. Earth's rotation: East to west, so sunrise in east, sunset in west.
2. Exceptions might be at the poles where the sun can remain below or above the horizon for extended periods, making it seem like it's moving sideways rather than east-west.
3. Optical illusions due to atmosphere could make the sun appear in a different direction temporarily.
4. Relative motion, like flying eastward very fast, could make the sun appear to rise in the west from your moving frame of reference.

So, under normal circumstances on most of Earth, the sun rises in the east. There are some edge cases where it might seem like it's rising elsewhere, but strictly speaking, no.

No.

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜>"

Okay, so the user provided a story and asked for a narrative analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They want the output in JSON with specific keys.

First, I need to parse through each part of the story step by step. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the analysis focuses on emotional links and tensions, I'll concentrate on interactions between them.

Starting with the storm caused by Tlaloc damaging the bridge. Then Jaguar_Knight gets injured trying to cross. The Princess knows he could die and uses a plant to heal him. This shows a positive action from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, so that's an emotional link of friendship or maybe love later on.

Next, Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions. So Princess is in danger, which introduces the 'prisoner' tension. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing determination, another positive emotional link.

Princess is angry at Enemy and confronts him. Meanwhile, Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom, indicating his focus on rescuing her. He finds Enemy, attacks, kills him, and frees Princess. This action shows bravery and strengthens their bond.

After being rescued, Princess admires Jaguar_Knight's bravery, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear emotional link of love. But then she sees his tattoo, linking him to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. So that's the 'clashing_emotions' tension.

She feels ambivalent, which is internal conflict. Then she kills Jaguar_Knight and herself. Both characters die, introducing the 'character_dead' tension. 

So the JSON needs to capture each action with subject, object, n_characters. I'll list them in order. Make sure each action is general, avoiding character names, using Snake_case.

I need to ensure that for actions without a clear subject or object, they're marked as '-'. Also, 'n_characters' should match the presence of subject and object. Each action should relate to emotional links (friendship, love) or tensions as defined.

Double-checking each event in the story: bridge collapse injures Jaguar_Knight, Princess heals him, Enemy kidnaps her, rescue efforts, killing Enemy, liberation, romantic kiss, discovering tattoo leading to conflict, their deaths. All these are key points to extract.

time=2025-04-02T10:50:35.199-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID.

Alright, I need to convert the given JSON into the DPS format as per the user's request. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

The JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.

First, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.

So, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be "Subject Action Object". If either is missing, I omit it.

Let me go through each action one by one:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.
2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.
3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.
6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.
7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.
8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.
12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.
13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.
14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.
16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.
17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.
19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.

I notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.

Wait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.

Now, for each action line:

- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as "Subject Action Object".
- If only one is present, just include that part.
- If neither is present, just the action.

Let me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is "storm_damage_bridge", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.

I'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR.

If either is missing, I omit it.\n\nLet me go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.\n2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.\n3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.\n\nI notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.\n\nWait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.\n\nNow, for each action line:\n\n- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as \"Subject Action Object\".\n- If only one is present, just include that part.\n- If neither is present, just the action.\n\nLet me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is \"storm_damage_bridge\", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.\n\nI'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nstorm Actor\nbridge Actor\njaguar_knight Actor\nprincess Actor\ntlaloc Actor\nquetzalcoatl Actor\nenemy Actor\nhuitzilopochtli Actor\ntonatiuh Actor\n\nstorm_damage_bridge\ncharacter_injured jaguar_knight\ncharacter_healed princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_realize_gratitude jaguar_knight\nenemy_kidnap_princess enemy princess\ncharacter_tied_to_rock enemy princess\ncharacter_pray_for_wisdom jaguar_knight\ncharacter_search_for_enemy jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_attack_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_throw_dust_in_face jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_perforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_take_heart_as_offering jaguar_knight\ncharacter_liberate_princess jaguar_knight princess\ncharacter_fall_in_love princess jaguar_knight\ncharacters_share_romantic_kiss princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_recognize_tattoo princess\ncharacter_feel_ambivalent_emotions princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_jugular princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_own_throat princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess. My task is to add a 'preconditions' key to each action, focusing on emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.

First, I should understand what an emotional link precondition means. It's about the relationship between characters that makes their actions plausible. For example, if jaguar_knight heals princess, there must be some positive emotional link like friendship or love.

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no preconditions.
2. **character_injured**: Only jaguar_knight is affected; no preconditions needed since it's an event, not an action driven by emotion.
3. **character_healed**: Princess heals jaguar_knight, implying a positive emotional link like friendship or love from princess to jaguar_knight.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels gratitude towards princess, indicating a positive emotional link from him to her.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Enemy kidnaps princess; likely motivated by negative emotions (revenge), so enemy has a negative emotional link towards princess.
6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to the kidnapping; same as above, negative link from enemy to princess.
7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight prays for wisdom to rescue princess, showing his positive feelings towards her.
8. **character_search_for_enemy**: jaguar_knight's search is driven by his positive emotional links with princess and maybe anger towards enemy.
9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: jaguar_knight attacks enemy, likely due to negative emotions towards enemy (anger) and positive towards princess.
10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack, driven by anger towards enemy.
11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Again, negative emotions towards enemy.
12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: jaguar_knight's action here might be driven by respect or adherence to traditions, but no direct emotional link unless it's towards the gods, which isn't specified in characters.
13. **character_liberate_princess**: Positive feelings from jaguar_knight towards princess.
14. **character_fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for jaguar_knight after rescue.
15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both have romantic feelings for each other, mutual love link.
16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: princess feels ambivalent emotions upon recognizing the tattoo, indicating a shift in her feelings towards jaguar_knight from positive to negative.
17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess has conflicting feelings about jaguar_knight.
18. **character_cut_jugular**: princess acts out of hatred towards jaguar_knight due to discovering his connection to her father's murder.
19. **character_cut_own_throat**: princess's grief and guilt lead to self-harm, driven by negative emotions towards herself or others.

I need to ensure that each precondition accurately reflects the emotional state necessary for the action. For example, healing implies positive links, while attacking implies negative ones. Mutual romantic actions show love between both characters.

Now, I'll structure this into JSON, adding 'preconditions' with 'emotional_links' as specified. Each link will have type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b'). If no emotional link is needed, the array stays empty.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so the user provided a story and asked for a narrative analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They want the output in JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through each part of the story step by step. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the analysis focuses on emotional links and tensions, I'll concentrate on interactions between them.\n\nStarting with the storm caused by Tlaloc damaging the bridge. Then Jaguar_Knight gets injured trying to cross. The Princess knows he could die and uses a plant to heal him. This shows a positive action from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, so that's an emotional link of friendship or maybe love later on.\n\nNext, Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions. So Princess is in danger, which introduces the 'prisoner' tension. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing determination, another positive emotional link.\n\nPrincess is angry at Enemy and confronts him. Meanwhile, Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom, indicating his focus on rescuing her. He finds Enemy, attacks, kills him, and frees Princess. This action shows bravery and strengthens their bond.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess admires Jaguar_Knight's bravery, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear emotional link of love. But then she sees his tattoo, linking him to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. So that's the 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\nShe feels ambivalent, which is internal conflict. Then she kills Jaguar_Knight and herself. Both characters die, introducing the 'character_dead' tension. \n\nSo the JSON needs to capture each action with subject, object, n_characters. I'll list them in order. Make sure each action is general, avoiding character names, using Snake_case.\n\nI need to ensure that for actions without a clear subject or object, they're marked as '-'. Also, 'n_characters' should match the presence of subject and object. Each action should relate to emotional links (friendship, love) or tensions as defined.\n\nDouble-checking each event in the story: bridge collapse injures Jaguar_Knight, Princess heals him, Enemy kidnaps her, rescue efforts, killing Enemy, liberation, romantic kiss, discovering tattoo leading to conflict, their deaths. All these are key points to extract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_healed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realize_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_tied_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_take_heart_as_offering\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fall_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"characters_share_romantic_kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_feel_ambivalent_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to convert the given JSON into the DPS format as per the user's request. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.\n\nThe JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.\n\nSo, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be \"Subject Action Object\". If either is missing, I omit it.\n\nLet me go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.\n2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.\n3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.\n\nI notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.\n\nWait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.\n\nNow, for each action line:\n\n- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as \"Subject Action Object\".\n- If only one is present, just include that part.\n- If neither is present, just the action.\n\nLet me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is \"storm_damage_bridge\", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.\n\nI'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nstorm Actor\nbridge Actor\njaguar_knight Actor\nprincess Actor\ntlaloc Actor\nquetzalcoatl Actor\nenemy Actor\nhuitzilopochtli Actor\ntonatiuh Actor\n\nstorm_damage_bridge\ncharacter_injured jaguar_knight\ncharacter_healed princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_realize_gratitude jaguar_knight\nenemy_kidnap_princess enemy princess\ncharacter_tied_to_rock enemy princess\ncharacter_pray_for_wisdom jaguar_knight\ncharacter_search_for_enemy jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_attack_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_throw_dust_in_face jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_perforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_take_heart_as_offering jaguar_knight\ncharacter_liberate_princess jaguar_knight princess\ncharacter_fall_in_love princess jaguar_knight\ncharacters_share_romantic_kiss princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_recognize_tattoo princess\ncharacter_feel_ambivalent_emotions princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_jugular princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_own_throat princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess. My task is to add a 'preconditions' key to each action, focusing on emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an emotional link precondition means. It's about the relationship between characters that makes their actions plausible. For example, if jaguar_knight heals princess, there must be some positive emotional link like friendship or love.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no preconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: Only jaguar_knight is affected; no preconditions needed since it's an event, not an action driven by emotion.\n3. **character_healed**: Princess heals jaguar_knight, implying a positive emotional link like friendship or love from princess to jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels gratitude towards princess, indicating a positive emotional link from him to her.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Enemy kidnaps princess; likely motivated by negative emotions (revenge), so enemy has a negative emotional link towards princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to the kidnapping; same as above, negative link from enemy to princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight prays for wisdom to rescue princess, showing his positive feelings towards her.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: jaguar_knight's search is driven by his positive emotional links with princess and maybe anger towards enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: jaguar_knight attacks enemy, likely due to negative emotions towards enemy (anger) and positive towards princess.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack, driven by anger towards enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Again, negative emotions towards enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: jaguar_knight's action here might be driven by respect or adherence to traditions, but no direct emotional link unless it's towards the gods, which isn't specified in characters.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Positive feelings from jaguar_knight towards princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for jaguar_knight after rescue.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both have romantic feelings for each other, mutual love link.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: princess feels ambivalent emotions upon recognizing the tattoo, indicating a shift in her feelings towards jaguar_knight from positive to negative.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess has conflicting feelings about jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: princess acts out of hatred towards jaguar_knight due to discovering his connection to her father's murder.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: princess's grief and guilt lead to self-harm, driven by negative emotions towards herself or others.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition accurately reflects the emotional state necessary for the action. For example, healing implies positive links, while attacking implies negative ones. Mutual romantic actions show love between both characters.\n\nNow, I'll structure this into JSON, adding 'preconditions' with 'emotional_links' as specified.

<think>
Alright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has given a story with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add a 'tensions' key under 'preconditions' for each action.

First, I should understand what each tension type means:

1. **character_dead**: A character has died.
2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.
3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.
4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.
5. **clashing_emotions**: A character has conflicting emotional links towards another.
6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.

For each action, I'll determine if any of these tensions must exist for the action to make sense. Let's go through them one by one:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no tensions.
2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, indicating health_at_risk.
3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight; implies his health was at risk before healing.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: No direct tension here, but gratitude might relate to previous health risks.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Princess is kidnapped, creating a prisoner tension.
6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to kidnapping; prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.
7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's prayer might be due to the princess being in danger (life_at_risk).
8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by the need to rescue princess from enemy, indicating she's a prisoner and her life is at risk.
9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Attack on enemy suggests both characters' lives are at risk.
10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack; life_at_risk for both.
11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Severe action leading to health_at_risk or character_dead.
12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Follows a lethal action, so enemy is dead (character_dead).
13. **character_liberate_princess**: Ends her prisoner status; prior condition was prisoner.
14. **character_fall_in_love**: No direct tension unless unrequited love causes love_competition, but in this case, it's mutual.
15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Mutual love, so no competition here.
16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing_emotions in princess towards jaguar_knight.
17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Princess has conflicting emotions, creating clashing_emotions tension.
18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death (character_dead) and health_at_risk for princess.
19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death (character_dead).

I'll structure this into JSON by adding 'tensions' under 'preconditions' for each action, specifying the type and the characters involved as 'from' and 'to'. If no tension is required, the array remains empty.

Now, I'll update each action with the appropriate tensions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so the user provided a story and asked for a narrative analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They want the output in JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through each part of the story step by step. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the analysis focuses on emotional links and tensions, I'll concentrate on interactions between them.\n\nStarting with the storm caused by Tlaloc damaging the bridge. Then Jaguar_Knight gets injured trying to cross. The Princess knows he could die and uses a plant to heal him. This shows a positive action from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, so that's an emotional link of friendship or maybe love later on.\n\nNext, Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions. So Princess is in danger, which introduces the 'prisoner' tension. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing determination, another positive emotional link.\n\nPrincess is angry at Enemy and confronts him. Meanwhile, Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom, indicating his focus on rescuing her. He finds Enemy, attacks, kills him, and frees Princess. This action shows bravery and strengthens their bond.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess admires Jaguar_Knight's bravery, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear emotional link of love. But then she sees his tattoo, linking him to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. So that's the 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\nShe feels ambivalent, which is internal conflict. Then she kills Jaguar_Knight and herself. Both characters die, introducing the 'character_dead' tension. \n\nSo the JSON needs to capture each action with subject, object, n_characters. I'll list them in order. Make sure each action is general, avoiding character names, using Snake_case.\n\nI need to ensure that for actions without a clear subject or object, they're marked as '-'. Also, 'n_characters' should match the presence of subject and object. Each action should relate to emotional links (friendship, love) or tensions as defined.\n\nDouble-checking each event in the story: bridge collapse injures Jaguar_Knight, Princess heals him, Enemy kidnaps her, rescue efforts, killing Enemy, liberation, romantic kiss, discovering tattoo leading to conflict, their deaths. All these are key points to extract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_healed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realize_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_tied_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_take_heart_as_offering\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fall_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"characters_share_romantic_kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_feel_ambivalent_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

Let me start by understanding what the user provided.\n\nThe JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.\n\nSo, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be \"Subject Action Object\". If either is missing, I omit it.\n\nLet me go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.\n2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.\n3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.\n\nI notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.\n\nWait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.\n\nNow, for each action line:\n\n- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as \"Subject Action Object\".\n- If only one is present, just include that part.\n- If neither is present, just the action.\n\nLet me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is \"storm_damage_bridge\", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.\n\nI'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nstorm Actor\nbridge Actor\njaguar_knight Actor\nprincess Actor\ntlaloc Actor\nquetzalcoatl Actor\nenemy Actor\nhuitzilopochtli Actor\ntonatiuh Actor\n\nstorm_damage_bridge\ncharacter_injured jaguar_knight\ncharacter_healed princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_realize_gratitude jaguar_knight\nenemy_kidnap_princess enemy princess\ncharacter_tied_to_rock enemy princess\ncharacter_pray_for_wisdom jaguar_knight\ncharacter_search_for_enemy jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_attack_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_throw_dust_in_face jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_perforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_take_heart_as_offering jaguar_knight\ncharacter_liberate_princess jaguar_knight princess\ncharacter_fall_in_love princess jaguar_knight\ncharacters_share_romantic_kiss princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_recognize_tattoo princess\ncharacter_feel_ambivalent_emotions princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_jugular princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_own_throat princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess. My task is to add a 'preconditions' key to each action, focusing on emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an emotional link precondition means. It's about the relationship between characters that makes their actions plausible. For example, if jaguar_knight heals princess, there must be some positive emotional link like friendship or love.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no preconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: Only jaguar_knight is affected; no preconditions needed since it's an event, not an action driven by emotion.\n3. **character_healed**: Princess heals jaguar_knight, implying a positive emotional link like friendship or love from princess to jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels gratitude towards princess, indicating a positive emotional link from him to her.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Enemy kidnaps princess; likely motivated by negative emotions (revenge), so enemy has a negative emotional link towards princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to the kidnapping; same as above, negative link from enemy to princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight prays for wisdom to rescue princess, showing his positive feelings towards her.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: jaguar_knight's search is driven by his positive emotional links with princess and maybe anger towards enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: jaguar_knight attacks enemy, likely due to negative emotions towards enemy (anger) and positive towards princess.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack, driven by anger towards enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Again, negative emotions towards enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: jaguar_knight's action here might be driven by respect or adherence to traditions, but no direct emotional link unless it's towards the gods, which isn't specified in characters.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Positive feelings from jaguar_knight towards princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for jaguar_knight after rescue.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both have romantic feelings for each other, mutual love link.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: princess feels ambivalent emotions upon recognizing the tattoo, indicating a shift in her feelings towards jaguar_knight from positive to negative.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess has conflicting feelings about jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: princess acts out of hatred towards jaguar_knight due to discovering his connection to her father's murder.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: princess's grief and guilt lead to self-harm, driven by negative emotions towards herself or others.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition accurately reflects the emotional state necessary for the action. For example, healing implies positive links, while attacking implies negative ones. Mutual romantic actions show love between both characters.\n\nNow, I'll structure this into JSON, adding 'preconditions' with 'emotional_links' as specified. Each link will have type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b'). If no emotional link is needed, the array stays empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has given a story with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add a 'tensions' key under 'preconditions' for each action.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each tension type means:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n5. **clashing_emotions**: A character has conflicting emotional links towards another.\n6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine if any of these tensions must exist for the action to make sense. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no tensions.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, indicating health_at_risk.\n3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight; implies his health was at risk before healing.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: No direct tension here, but gratitude might relate to previous health risks.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Princess is kidnapped, creating a prisoner tension.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to kidnapping; prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's prayer might be due to the princess being in danger (life_at_risk).\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by the need to rescue princess from enemy, indicating she's a prisoner and her life is at risk.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Attack on enemy suggests both characters' lives are at risk.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack; life_at_risk for both.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Severe action leading to health_at_risk or character_dead.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Follows a lethal action, so enemy is dead (character_dead).\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Ends her prisoner status; prior condition was prisoner.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: No direct tension unless unrequited love causes love_competition, but in this case, it's mutual.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Mutual love, so no competition here.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing_emotions in princess towards jaguar_knight.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Princess has conflicting emotions, creating clashing_emotions tension.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death (character_dead) and health_at_risk for princess.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death (character_dead).\n\nI'll structure this into JSON by adding 'tensions' under 'preconditions' for each action, specifying the type and the characters involved as 'from' and 'to'. If no tension is required, the array remains empty.\n\nNow, I'll update each action with the appropriate tensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character.

Okay, so I need to help the user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add 'postconditions' that include changes to emotional links and tensions.

First, I should understand what postconditions mean. Postconditions are the results or changes caused by an action. They can affect either emotional links (making them stronger, weaker, or changing their type) or tensions (resolving or intensifying them).

I need to go through each action one by one:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no postconditions.
2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight's health is at risk, so health_at_risk tension arises.
3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight, resolving health_at_risk and possibly improving their friendship.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels grateful towards princess, enhancing their emotional link.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner and life_at_risk tensions for princess.
6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Intensifies prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.
7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's determination strengthens his friendship with princess.
8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, no new emotional links but maintains the search tension.
9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Intensifies life_at_risk for both and creates negative emotions towards enemy.
10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Similar to attack, keeps life_at_risk active.
11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Results in enemy's death (character_dead) and possibly health issues for jaguar_knight.
12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: No direct tension resolution; just an action following enemy's death.
13. **character_liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, strengthens friendship.
14. **character_fall_in_love**: Develops romantic feelings between princess and jaguar_knight.
15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Strengthens mutual love links.
16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Princess feels ambivalent emotions towards jaguar_knight.
17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Introduces clashing_emotions tension for princess.
18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death and health_at_risk for princess.
19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death, resolving her tensions.

I need to ensure that each postcondition accurately reflects the changes caused by the action, both in emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), I'll include the corresponding normal tension (prisoner_freed). Emotional links should be updated based on whether the action had a positive or negative impact.

Now, I'll update each action with these postconditions.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so the user provided a story and asked for a narrative analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They want the output in JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through each part of the story step by step. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the analysis focuses on emotional links and tensions, I'll concentrate on interactions between them.\n\nStarting with the storm caused by Tlaloc damaging the bridge. Then Jaguar_Knight gets injured trying to cross. The Princess knows he could die and uses a plant to heal him. This shows a positive action from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, so that's an emotional link of friendship or maybe love later on.\n\nNext, Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions. So Princess is in danger, which introduces the 'prisoner' tension. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing determination, another positive emotional link.\n\nPrincess is angry at Enemy and confronts him. Meanwhile, Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom, indicating his focus on rescuing her. He finds Enemy, attacks, kills him, and frees Princess. This action shows bravery and strengthens their bond.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess admires Jaguar_Knight's bravery, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear emotional link of love. But then she sees his tattoo, linking him to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. So that's the 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\nShe feels ambivalent, which is internal conflict. Then she kills Jaguar_Knight and herself. Both characters die, introducing the 'character_dead' tension. \n\nSo the JSON needs to capture each action with subject, object, n_characters. I'll list them in order. Make sure each action is general, avoiding character names, using Snake_case.\n\nI need to ensure that for actions without a clear subject or object, they're marked as '-'. Also, 'n_characters' should match the presence of subject and object. Each action should relate to emotional links (friendship, love) or tensions as defined.\n\nDouble-checking each event in the story: bridge collapse injures Jaguar_Knight, Princess heals him, Enemy kidnaps her, rescue efforts, killing Enemy, liberation, romantic kiss, discovering tattoo leading to conflict, their deaths. All these are key points to extract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_healed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realize_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_tied_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_take_heart_as_offering\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fall_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"characters_share_romantic_kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_feel_ambivalent_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

Let me start by understanding what the user provided.\n\nThe JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.\n\nSo, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be \"Subject Action Object\". If either is missing, I omit it.\n\nLet me go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.\n2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.\n3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.\n\nI notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.\n\nWait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.\n\nNow, for each action line:\n\n- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as \"Subject Action Object\".\n- If only one is present, just include that part.\n- If neither is present, just the action.\n\nLet me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is \"storm_damage_bridge\", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.\n\nI'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nstorm Actor\nbridge Actor\njaguar_knight Actor\nprincess Actor\ntlaloc Actor\nquetzalcoatl Actor\nenemy Actor\nhuitzilopochtli Actor\ntonatiuh Actor\n\nstorm_damage_bridge\ncharacter_injured jaguar_knight\ncharacter_healed princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_realize_gratitude jaguar_knight\nenemy_kidnap_princess enemy princess\ncharacter_tied_to_rock enemy princess\ncharacter_pray_for_wisdom jaguar_knight\ncharacter_search_for_enemy jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_attack_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_throw_dust_in_face jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_perforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_take_heart_as_offering jaguar_knight\ncharacter_liberate_princess jaguar_knight princess\ncharacter_fall_in_love princess jaguar_knight\ncharacters_share_romantic_kiss princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_recognize_tattoo princess\ncharacter_feel_ambivalent_emotions princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_jugular princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_own_throat princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess. My task is to add a 'preconditions' key to each action, focusing on emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an emotional link precondition means. It's about the relationship between characters that makes their actions plausible. For example, if jaguar_knight heals princess, there must be some positive emotional link like friendship or love.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no preconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: Only jaguar_knight is affected; no preconditions needed since it's an event, not an action driven by emotion.\n3. **character_healed**: Princess heals jaguar_knight, implying a positive emotional link like friendship or love from princess to jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels gratitude towards princess, indicating a positive emotional link from him to her.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Enemy kidnaps princess; likely motivated by negative emotions (revenge), so enemy has a negative emotional link towards princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to the kidnapping; same as above, negative link from enemy to princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight prays for wisdom to rescue princess, showing his positive feelings towards her.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: jaguar_knight's search is driven by his positive emotional links with princess and maybe anger towards enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: jaguar_knight attacks enemy, likely due to negative emotions towards enemy (anger) and positive towards princess.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack, driven by anger towards enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Again, negative emotions towards enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: jaguar_knight's action here might be driven by respect or adherence to traditions, but no direct emotional link unless it's towards the gods, which isn't specified in characters.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Positive feelings from jaguar_knight towards princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for jaguar_knight after rescue.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both have romantic feelings for each other, mutual love link.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: princess feels ambivalent emotions upon recognizing the tattoo, indicating a shift in her feelings towards jaguar_knight from positive to negative.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess has conflicting feelings about jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: princess acts out of hatred towards jaguar_knight due to discovering his connection to her father's murder.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: princess's grief and guilt lead to self-harm, driven by negative emotions towards herself or others.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition accurately reflects the emotional state necessary for the action. For example, healing implies positive links, while attacking implies negative ones. Mutual romantic actions show love between both characters.\n\nNow, I'll structure this into JSON, adding 'preconditions' with 'emotional_links' as specified. Each link will have type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b'). If no emotional link is needed, the array stays empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has given a story with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add a 'tensions' key under 'preconditions' for each action.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each tension type means:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n5. **clashing_emotions**: A character has conflicting emotional links towards another.\n6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine if any of these tensions must exist for the action to make sense. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no tensions.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, indicating health_at_risk.\n3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight; implies his health was at risk before healing.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: No direct tension here, but gratitude might relate to previous health risks.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Princess is kidnapped, creating a prisoner tension.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to kidnapping; prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's prayer might be due to the princess being in danger (life_at_risk).\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by the need to rescue princess from enemy, indicating she's a prisoner and her life is at risk.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Attack on enemy suggests both characters' lives are at risk.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack; life_at_risk for both.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Severe action leading to health_at_risk or character_dead.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Follows a lethal action, so enemy is dead (character_dead).\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Ends her prisoner status; prior condition was prisoner.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: No direct tension unless unrequited love causes love_competition, but in this case, it's mutual.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Mutual love, so no competition here.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing_emotions in princess towards jaguar_knight.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Princess has conflicting emotions, creating clashing_emotions tension.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death (character_dead) and health_at_risk for princess.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death (character_dead).\n\nI'll structure this into JSON by adding 'tensions' under 'preconditions' for each action, specifying the type and the characters involved as 'from' and 'to'. If no tension is required, the array remains empty.\n\nNow, I'll update each action with the appropriate tensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add 'postconditions' that include changes to emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, I should understand what postconditions mean. Postconditions are the results or changes caused by an action. They can affect either emotional links (making them stronger, weaker, or changing their type) or tensions (resolving or intensifying them).\n\nI need to go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no postconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight's health is at risk, so health_at_risk tension arises.\n3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight, resolving health_at_risk and possibly improving their friendship.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels grateful towards princess, enhancing their emotional link.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner and life_at_risk tensions for princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Intensifies prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's determination strengthens his friendship with princess.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, no new emotional links but maintains the search tension.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Intensifies life_at_risk for both and creates negative emotions towards enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Similar to attack, keeps life_at_risk active.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Results in enemy's death (character_dead) and possibly health issues for jaguar_knight.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: No direct tension resolution; just an action following enemy's death.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, strengthens friendship.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Develops romantic feelings between princess and jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Strengthens mutual love links.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Princess feels ambivalent emotions towards jaguar_knight.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Introduces clashing_emotions tension for princess.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death and health_at_risk for princess.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death, resolving her tensions.\n\nI need to ensure that each postcondition accurately reflects the changes caused by the action, both in emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), I'll include the corresponding normal tension (prisoner_freed). Emotional links should be updated based on whether the action had a positive or negative impact.\n\nNow, I'll update each action with these postconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n<｜Assistant｜>"

Alright, I need to ensure logical consistency in each action's preconditions and postconditions based on the user's instructions. The key points are:

1. **n_characters** should match the number of characters referenced.
2. If a character dies, they can't have further emotional links or tensions.
3. Postconditions must differ from preconditions.
4. Use only 'a' for subject and 'b' for object in emotional links and tensions.
5. Avoid illogical situations.

I'll go through each action:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters, so no issues.
2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, health_at_risk applies.
3. **character_healed**: Resolves health_at_risk, strengthens friendship.
4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only jaguar_knight, no death involved.
5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **character_tied_to_rock**: princess is prisoner and at risk.
6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: No death, only jaguar_knight's emotions.
7. **character_search_for_enemy**: Both characters are alive, no issues.
8. **character_attack_with_dagger**, **character_throw_dust_in_face**, **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: All involve living characters with life_at_risk.
9. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Occurs after enemy's death, so no further tensions for enemy.
10. **character_liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner and life_at_risk for princess.
11. **character_fall_in_love** and **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both characters are alive, mutual emotions.
12. **character_recognize_tattoo** and **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess's conflicting emotions, no death yet.
13. **character_cut_jugular** and **character_cut_own_throat**: Both characters die, so no further links or tensions.

I need to ensure that in actions where a character dies, they don't have any postconditions affecting them. Also, verify that 'a' and 'b' are correctly used, and emotional links in postconditions differ from preconditions.

time=2025-04-02T10:58:43.571-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so the user provided a story and asked for a narrative analysis focusing on emotional links and tensions. They want the output in JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through each part of the story step by step. The main characters are Jaguar_Knight, Princess, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, Enemy, Huitzilopochtli, Tonatiuh. But since the analysis focuses on emotional links and tensions, I'll concentrate on interactions between them.\n\nStarting with the storm caused by Tlaloc damaging the bridge. Then Jaguar_Knight gets injured trying to cross. The Princess knows he could die and uses a plant to heal him. This shows a positive action from Princess towards Jaguar_Knight, so that's an emotional link of friendship or maybe love later on.\n\nNext, Enemy kidnaps Princess as revenge for her father's actions. So Princess is in danger, which introduces the 'prisoner' tension. Jaguar_Knight decides to rescue her, showing determination, another positive emotional link.\n\nPrincess is angry at Enemy and confronts him. Meanwhile, Jaguar_Knight prays for wisdom, indicating his focus on rescuing her. He finds Enemy, attacks, kills him, and frees Princess. This action shows bravery and strengthens their bond.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess admires Jaguar_Knight's bravery, leading to romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear emotional link of love. But then she sees his tattoo, linking him to her father's murderers. This creates clashing emotions because she loves him but hates his actions. So that's the 'clashing_emotions' tension.\n\nShe feels ambivalent, which is internal conflict. Then she kills Jaguar_Knight and herself. Both characters die, introducing the 'character_dead' tension. \n\nSo the JSON needs to capture each action with subject, object, n_characters. I'll list them in order. Make sure each action is general, avoiding character names, using Snake_case.\n\nI need to ensure that for actions without a clear subject or object, they're marked as '-'. Also, 'n_characters' should match the presence of subject and object. Each action should relate to emotional links (friendship, love) or tensions as defined.\n\nDouble-checking each event in the story: bridge collapse injures Jaguar_Knight, Princess heals him, Enemy kidnaps her, rescue efforts, killing Enemy, liberation, romantic kiss, discovering tattoo leading to conflict, their deaths. All these are key points to extract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_injured\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_healed\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_realize_gratitude\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"enemy_kidnap_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_tied_to_rock\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_pray_for_wisdom\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_search_for_enemy\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_attack_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_throw_dust_in_face\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"enemy\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_take_heart_as_offering\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_liberate_princess\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n    \"object\": \"princess\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_fall_in_love\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"characters_share_romantic_kiss\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_recognize_tattoo\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_feel_ambivalent_emotions\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_jugular\",\n    \"n_characters\": 2,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"character_cut_own_throat\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"princess\",\n    \"object\": \"-\"\n  }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to convert the given JSON into the DPS format as per the user's request. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.\n\nThe JSON contains a series of actions from the story, each with 'action', 'n_characters', 'subject', and 'object'. The task is to translate these into the specified DPS structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the example the user gave. It starts with 'Sto ;1' followed by the actors involved and then the sequence of actions. Each action line includes the subject, action, and object if applicable.\n\nSo, for each JSON object, I need to create a corresponding action line in DPS. If an action has both subject and object, it'll be \"Subject Action Object\". If either is missing, I omit it.\n\nLet me go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No subject or object, so just the action.\n2. **character_injured**: Object is jaguar_knight, no subject mentioned.\n3. **character_healed**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Subject is enemy, object is princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: Subject is jaguar_knight.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Only subject, jaguar_knight.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Subject is jaguar_knight, object is princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both subjects are princess and jaguar_knight.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Only subject, princess.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Subject is princess, object is jaguar_knight.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Only subject, princess.\n\nI notice that the DPS example lists all actors first and then actions. So I'll list all unique characters involved: storm, bridge, jaguar_knight, princess, tlaloc, quetzalcoatl, enemy, huitzilopochtli, tonatiuh.\n\nWait, in the JSON, some actions don't have specific subjects or objects, so in DPS, they might not need to be listed as actors. But since the example includes all involved characters, I'll include them.\n\nNow, for each action line:\n\n- If 'subject' and 'object' are present, format as \"Subject Action Object\".\n- If only one is present, just include that part.\n- If neither is present, just the action.\n\nLet me construct each line accordingly. For example, the first action in JSON is \"storm_damage_bridge\", which doesn't have subject or object, so it's just that action string.\n\nI'll proceed similarly for all actions, ensuring consistency with the format and including all necessary characters as actors at the top.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nstorm Actor\nbridge Actor\njaguar_knight Actor\nprincess Actor\ntlaloc Actor\nquetzalcoatl Actor\nenemy Actor\nhuitzilopochtli Actor\ntonatiuh Actor\n\nstorm_damage_bridge\ncharacter_injured jaguar_knight\ncharacter_healed princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_realize_gratitude jaguar_knight\nenemy_kidnap_princess enemy princess\ncharacter_tied_to_rock enemy princess\ncharacter_pray_for_wisdom jaguar_knight\ncharacter_search_for_enemy jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_attack_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_throw_dust_in_face jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_perforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight enemy\ncharacter_take_heart_as_offering jaguar_knight\ncharacter_liberate_princess jaguar_knight princess\ncharacter_fall_in_love princess jaguar_knight\ncharacters_share_romantic_kiss princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_recognize_tattoo princess\ncharacter_feel_ambivalent_emotions princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_jugular princess jaguar_knight\ncharacter_cut_own_throat princess\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by identifying preconditions related to emotional links for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess. My task is to add a 'preconditions' key to each action, focusing on emotional links that must exist for the action to make sense.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an emotional link precondition means. It's about the relationship between characters that makes their actions plausible. For example, if jaguar_knight heals princess, there must be some positive emotional link like friendship or love.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no preconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: Only jaguar_knight is affected; no preconditions needed since it's an event, not an action driven by emotion.\n3. **character_healed**: Princess heals jaguar_knight, implying a positive emotional link like friendship or love from princess to jaguar_knight.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels gratitude towards princess, indicating a positive emotional link from him to her.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Enemy kidnaps princess; likely motivated by negative emotions (revenge), so enemy has a negative emotional link towards princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to the kidnapping; same as above, negative link from enemy to princess.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight prays for wisdom to rescue princess, showing his positive feelings towards her.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: jaguar_knight's search is driven by his positive emotional links with princess and maybe anger towards enemy.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: jaguar_knight attacks enemy, likely due to negative emotions towards enemy (anger) and positive towards princess.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack, driven by anger towards enemy.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Again, negative emotions towards enemy.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: jaguar_knight's action here might be driven by respect or adherence to traditions, but no direct emotional link unless it's towards the gods, which isn't specified in characters.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Positive feelings from jaguar_knight towards princess.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for jaguar_knight after rescue.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both have romantic feelings for each other, mutual love link.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: princess feels ambivalent emotions upon recognizing the tattoo, indicating a shift in her feelings towards jaguar_knight from positive to negative.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess has conflicting feelings about jaguar_knight.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: princess acts out of hatred towards jaguar_knight due to discovering his connection to her father's murder.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: princess's grief and guilt lead to self-harm, driven by negative emotions towards herself or others.\n\nI need to ensure that each precondition accurately reflects the emotional state necessary for the action. For example, healing implies positive links, while attacking implies negative ones. Mutual romantic actions show love between both characters.\n\nNow, I'll structure this into JSON, adding 'preconditions' with 'emotional_links' as specified. Each link will have type, magnitude, and direction (from 'a' to 'b'). If no emotional link is needed, the array stays empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n    \"n_characters\": 1,\n    \"subject\": \"-\",\n    \"object\":

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to identify or infer preconditions related to tensions for each action in the provided JSON. The user has given a story with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add a 'tensions' key under 'preconditions' for each action.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each tension type means:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character’s life is at risk.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is at risk.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is in prison or detained.\n5. **clashing_emotions**: A character has conflicting emotional links towards another.\n6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine if any of these tensions must exist for the action to make sense. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no tensions.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, indicating health_at_risk.\n3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight; implies his health was at risk before healing.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: No direct tension here, but gratitude might relate to previous health risks.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Princess is kidnapped, creating a prisoner tension.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Related to kidnapping; prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's prayer might be due to the princess being in danger (life_at_risk).\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by the need to rescue princess from enemy, indicating she's a prisoner and her life is at risk.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Attack on enemy suggests both characters' lives are at risk.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Same as attack; life_at_risk for both.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Severe action leading to health_at_risk or character_dead.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Follows a lethal action, so enemy is dead (character_dead).\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Ends her prisoner status; prior condition was prisoner.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: No direct tension unless unrequited love causes love_competition, but in this case, it's mutual.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Mutual love, so no competition here.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing_emotions in princess towards jaguar_knight.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Princess has conflicting emotions, creating clashing_emotions tension.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death (character_dead) and health_at_risk for princess.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death (character_dead).\n\nI'll structure this into JSON by adding 'tensions' under 'preconditions' for each action, specifying the type and the characters involved as 'from' and 'to'. If no tension is required, the array remains empty.\n\nNow, I'll update each action with the appropriate tensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user by identifying postconditions for each action in their story. The user has provided a JSON structure with actions involving characters like jaguar_knight and princess, and my task is to add 'postconditions' that include changes to emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, I should understand what postconditions mean. Postconditions are the results or changes caused by an action. They can affect either emotional links (making them stronger, weaker, or changing their type) or tensions (resolving or intensifying them).\n\nI need to go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters involved, so no postconditions.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight's health is at risk, so health_at_risk tension arises.\n3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight, resolving health_at_risk and possibly improving their friendship.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: jaguar_knight feels grateful towards princess, enhancing their emotional link.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner and life_at_risk tensions for princess.\n6. **character_tied_to_rock**: Intensifies prisoner and life_at_risk tensions.\n7. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: jaguar_knight's determination strengthens his friendship with princess.\n8. **character_search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, no new emotional links but maintains the search tension.\n9. **character_attack_with_dagger**: Intensifies life_at_risk for both and creates negative emotions towards enemy.\n10. **character_throw_dust_in_face**: Similar to attack, keeps life_at_risk active.\n11. **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Results in enemy's death (character_dead) and possibly health issues for jaguar_knight.\n12. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: No direct tension resolution; just an action following enemy's death.\n13. **character_liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner and life_at_risk tensions, strengthens friendship.\n14. **character_fall_in_love**: Develops romantic feelings between princess and jaguar_knight.\n15. **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Strengthens mutual love links.\n16. **character_recognize_tattoo**: Princess feels ambivalent emotions towards jaguar_knight.\n17. **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: Introduces clashing_emotions tension for princess.\n18. **character_cut_jugular**: Results in jaguar_knight's death and health_at_risk for princess.\n19. **character_cut_own_throat**: Leads to princess's death, resolving her tensions.\n\nI need to ensure that each postcondition accurately reflects the changes caused by the action, both in emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), I'll include the corresponding normal tension (prisoner_freed). Emotional links should be updated based on whether the action had a positive or negative impact.\n\nNow, I'll update each action with these postconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n

Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to ensure logical consistency in each action's preconditions and postconditions based on the user's instructions. The key points are:\n\n1. **n_characters** should match the number of characters referenced.\n2. If a character dies, they can't have further emotional links or tensions.\n3. Postconditions must differ from preconditions.\n4. Use only 'a' for subject and 'b' for object in emotional links and tensions.\n5. Avoid illogical situations.\n\nI'll go through each action:\n\n1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters, so no issues.\n2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, health_at_risk applies.\n3. **character_healed**: Resolves health_at_risk, strengthens friendship.\n4. **character_realize_gratitude**: Only jaguar_knight, no death involved.\n5. **enemy_kidnap_princess** and **character_tied_to_rock**: princess is prisoner and at risk.\n6. **character_pray_for_wisdom**: No death, only jaguar_knight's emotions.\n7. **character_search_for_enemy**: Both characters are alive, no issues.\n8. **character_attack_with_dagger**, **character_throw_dust_in_face**, **character_perforate_chest_with_dagger**: All involve living characters with life_at_risk.\n9. **character_take_heart_as_offering**: Occurs after enemy's death, so no further tensions for enemy.\n10. **character_liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner and life_at_risk for princess.\n11. **character_fall_in_love** and **characters_share_romantic_kiss**: Both characters are alive, mutual emotions.\n12. **character_recognize_tattoo** and **character_feel_ambivalent_emotions**: princess's conflicting emotions, no death yet.\n13. **character_cut_jugular** and **character_cut_own_throat**: Both characters die, so no further links or tensions.\n\nI need to ensure that in actions where a character dies, they don't have any postconditions affecting them. Also, verify that 'a' and 'b' are correctly used, and emotional links in postconditions differ from preconditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"storm_damage_bridge\",\n

Alright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the Primitive Action Description (PAD) language as per the user's instructions. The PAD syntax requires specifying each action with preconditions and postconditions in a specific format.

First, I'll review the PAD syntax:

- Each action starts with 'ACT' followed by the action name and number of characters.
- Preconditions are optional and listed under 'PRE'.
- Postconditions are mandatory and include both emotional links and tensions after 'POS'.

I need to ensure that each JSON object is accurately translated into PAD, maintaining the correct format for emotional links and tensions. Emotional links have a type (1 for friendship, 2 for love) and magnitude (with + or - signs). Tensions use specific codes like 'Lr' for life_at_risk.

Let's start with the first action:

1. **storm_damage_bridge**: No characters, so no preconditions or postconditions.
2. **character_injured**: jaguar_knight is injured, health_at_risk applies.
3. **character_healed**: princess heals jaguar_knight, resolving health_at_risk and strengthening friendship.

I'll structure each action in PAD accordingly, ensuring proper spacing and syntax. For actions without preconditions, I'll omit the 'PRE' section. Postconditions must always be present.

Now, I'll convert each JSON object into PAD format.
