<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the sun rises in the west. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the sun and its movement.

From what I remember, the Earth rotates from west to east. That means if you're standing on the Earth, it feels like the sky is moving from east to west because the Earth is spinning towards the east. So when we see the sun rise in the morning, it's because the Earth has rotated to face the sun again after being in darkness.

Wait, but does that mean the sun itself is moving? No, I think the sun is relatively stationary compared to our rotating Earth. So from our perspective on Earth, it looks like the sun moves across the sky from east to west each day. That's why we see sunrise in the east and sunset in the west.

But the question is asking if the sun rises in the west. That would mean the sun comes up in the western part of the horizon. But based on what I just thought, that doesn't happen under normal circumstances because Earth's rotation causes it to rise in the east.

However, are there any exceptions or special cases? For example, near the poles, the sunrise and sunset times can be really extreme during certain times of the year. In places like northern Alaska or parts of Scandinavia, they have midnight sun in the summer where the sun doesn't set for months, but does that make it rise in the west?

Wait, no. Even with the midnight sun, the direction from which the sun appears is still east. It's just that during the summer solstice near the Arctic Circle, the sun remains visible all day, circling around the sky without setting. So it doesn't really "rise" in the west; it might be visible all the time but moving in a circular path.

Another thought: could there be an optical illusion or atmospheric effect where the sun appears to rise in the west? I'm not sure about that. Maybe during certain weather conditions, like severe storms or something, but I don't think that's common or considered a normal sunrise.

Wait, actually, during some astronomical events, like when the Earth's rotation is paused or reversed... Wait, no, that doesn't happen. The Earth's rotation isn't going to reverse suddenly; it's a gradual process over millions of years, and even then, I'm not sure if it would cause the sun to rise in the west.

Wait, there's also the concept of the Sun's path changing due to the Earth's axial tilt. But that affects the seasons, making the sunrise point shift north or south, but not east to west.

Oh, what about during an eclipse? Does that affect where the sun rises? No, an eclipse just blocks part of the sun; it doesn't change its direction.

Wait a minute, could it be related to the Earth's orbit around the Sun? But no, that affects the time of year and seasons, not the daily rising direction.

So putting it all together, under normal circumstances on Earth, the sun rises in the east because of our west-to-east rotation. There are no common or natural phenomena where the sun would rise in the west without some extraordinary event, which isn't typically considered in everyday questions like this.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

No

Reading story action prompt from file:  prompts/story_action.txt
Story Action Prompt:  You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).

You are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. 

You are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:

1. `character_dead`
2. `life_at_risk`
3. `health_at_risk`
4. `prisoner`
5. `clashing_emotions`
6. `love_competition`

`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.

Analyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. 

Organize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.

Here is the story:

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS.

Alright, I need to analyze this story step by step as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions.

First, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross it and gets injured. That's definitely a health_at_risk situation since he's badly hurt.

Princess finds out about his condition and knows he could die. She uses a curative plant to heal him. This action shows her determination, so this is an emotional link of friendship because she's saving his life in a platonic way.

Jaguar_Knight realizes she saved him, which strengthens their bond. So that's another friendship emotional link as gratitude builds their relationship.

Next, there's a revenge plot where the enemy kidnaps Princess and ties her up. This creates prisoner tension for her. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing life_at_risk tension for both of them.

Princess is angry at the enemy, leading to clashing emotions because earlier she was scared but now she's confronting him. The enemy attacks her, which adds to the tension, specifically life_at_risk since she's about to be killed.

Jaguar prays for wisdom and bravery, showing his internal preparation but not directly an emotional link yet. He finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation where he attacks and kills the enemy. This frees Princess, so another prisoner tension resolution.

After being rescued, Princess feels admiration for Jaguar_Knight, developing romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear love emotional link.

But then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves him but hates what he did. She kills him and herself, leading to both characters_dead tension.

Each action needs to be in JSON with subject, object, and number of characters. I'll list them chronologically as they appear.

time=2025-04-02T13:03:29.619-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN.

Alright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the specified DPS format. First, I'll recall the structure of the DPS example given. It starts with 'Sto' followed by a number, then lists actors and actions.

Looking at the JSON, each action is between characters or involves one character. I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.

I notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.

I'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax. For actions without subjects or objects, I'll represent them with just the action name. Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.

I should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all. Finally, I'll compile all these into the DPS structure under the <DPS> tags.

Alright, I need to analyze each action from the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.

I'll go through each action one by one:

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event caused by a god, so no characters are involved. No emotional links here.

2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: An accident happens, injuring Jaguar_Knight. No emotional link preconditions needed for this to occur.

3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess acts to save Jaguar_Knight. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight, magnitude 3 (strong affection).

4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to the previous action, reinforcing the positive friendship link.

5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Jaguar_Knight feels gratitude towards Princess, indicating a positive friendship link.

6. **kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess out of revenge, suggesting hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Enemy to Princess).

7. **tie_to_rock**: The Enemy's action is driven by the same hatred.

8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight seeks help, indicating his determination and positive feelings towards Princess.

9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Princess confronts the Enemy angrily, showing hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Princess to Enemy).

10. **charge_against_princess**: The Enemy's action is motivated by anger, reinforcing their negative emotional link.

11. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's determination to save Princess shows strong positive feelings towards her.

12. **attack_with_dagger**: Anger drives Jaguar_Knight to attack the Enemy (friendship magnitude -3).

13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the combat, same as above.

14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Continuation of the attack, driven by anger.

15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: Jaguar_Knight's respect for gods, no direct emotional link to another character.

16. **liberate_princess**: Driven by positive feelings towards Princess (friendship magnitude 3).

17. **fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for Jaguar_Knight (love magnitude 3).

18. **kiss**: Affectionate action based on love.

19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to ambivalence in Princess, creating clashing emotions but not a direct precondition yet.

20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Princess has conflicting feelings, affecting her emotional state.

21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Emotional turmoil leads to hatred towards Jaguar_Knight (friendship magnitude -3).

22. **cut_jugular**: Driven by intense negative emotions (hatred).

23. **cut_own_throat**: Result of internal conflict and grief, no direct emotional link precondition needed.

I need to ensure each precondition is correctly assigned with type, magnitude, and direction ('from' and 'to'). For actions without clear preconditions, the array remains empty.

time=2025-04-02T13:05:03.004-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story step by step as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross it and gets injured. That's definitely a health_at_risk situation since he's badly hurt.\n\nPrincess finds out about his condition and knows he could die. She uses a curative plant to heal him. This action shows her determination, so this is an emotional link of friendship because she's saving his life in a platonic way.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizes she saved him, which strengthens their bond. So that's another friendship emotional link as gratitude builds their relationship.\n\nNext, there's a revenge plot where the enemy kidnaps Princess and ties her up. This creates prisoner tension for her. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing life_at_risk tension for both of them.\n\nPrincess is angry at the enemy, leading to clashing emotions because earlier she was scared but now she's confronting him. The enemy attacks her, which adds to the tension, specifically life_at_risk since she's about to be killed.\n\nJaguar prays for wisdom and bravery, showing his internal preparation but not directly an emotional link yet. He finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation where he attacks and kills the enemy. This frees Princess, so another prisoner tension resolution.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess feels admiration for Jaguar_Knight, developing romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear love emotional link.\n\nBut then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves him but hates what he did. She kills him and herself, leading to both characters_dead tension.\n\nEach action needs to be in JSON with subject, object, and number of characters. I'll list them chronologically as they appear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"bridge_collapse_injure_head\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"realize_determination_save_life\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kidnap_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"tie_to_rock\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"pray_for_wisdom_braveness\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"confront_enemy_angrily\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"charge_against_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_in_love\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kiss\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"feel_ambivalent_thoughts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_dead\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_jugular\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_own_throat\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

First, I'll recall the structure of the DPS example given. It starts with 'Sto' followed by a number, then lists actors and actions.\n\nLooking at the JSON, each action is between characters or involves one character. I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.\n\nI notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.\n\nI'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax. For actions without subjects or objects, I'll represent them with just the action name. Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.\n\nI should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1.

Alright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of several types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`.

I'll start by understanding what each tension means:

1. **character_dead**: A character has died.
2. **life_at_risk**: A character's life is in danger.
3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is compromised.
4. **prisoner**: A character is being held captive.
5. **clashing_emotions**: Conflicting emotions within a character towards another.
6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.

Now, I'll go through each action and determine if any tensions are preconditions for that action.

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event, no direct tension related to characters.
2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.
3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Done because Jaguar_Knight's health is at risk.
4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Same as above.
5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Implies life_at_risk.
6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.
7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces prisoner tension.
8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Driven by the need to save Princess, indicating her life is at risk.
9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Confrontation increases life_at_risk.
10. **charge_against_princess**: Direct threat to her life.
11. **search_for_enemy**: Motivated by Princess being a prisoner and her life at risk.
12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to liberate, so Princess is still a prisoner.
13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue, Princess still a prisoner.
14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Same as above.
15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct tension related to characters.
16. **liberate_princess**: Ends the prisoner tension.
17. **fall_in_love**: No tension here, just emotional link.
18. **kiss**: Same as above.
19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing emotions in Princess.
20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions.
21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Part of the tension leading to death.
22. **cut_jugular**: Results in character dead.
23. **cut_own_throat**: Also results in character dead.

For each action, I'll assign the relevant tensions as preconditions. If an action doesn't involve a tension, the array will be empty.

You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story step by step as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross it and gets injured. That's definitely a health_at_risk situation since he's badly hurt.\n\nPrincess finds out about his condition and knows he could die. She uses a curative plant to heal him. This action shows her determination, so this is an emotional link of friendship because she's saving his life in a platonic way.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizes she saved him, which strengthens their bond. So that's another friendship emotional link as gratitude builds their relationship.\n\nNext, there's a revenge plot where the enemy kidnaps Princess and ties her up. This creates prisoner tension for her. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing life_at_risk tension for both of them.\n\nPrincess is angry at the enemy, leading to clashing emotions because earlier she was scared but now she's confronting him. The enemy attacks her, which adds to the tension, specifically life_at_risk since she's about to be killed.\n\nJaguar prays for wisdom and bravery, showing his internal preparation but not directly an emotional link yet. He finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation where he attacks and kills the enemy. This frees Princess, so another prisoner tension resolution.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess feels admiration for Jaguar_Knight, developing romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear love emotional link.\n\nBut then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves him but hates what he did. She kills him and herself, leading to both characters_dead tension.\n\nEach action needs to be in JSON with subject, object, and number of characters. I'll list them chronologically as they appear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"bridge_collapse_injure_head\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"realize_determination_save_life\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kidnap_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"tie_to_rock\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"pray_for_wisdom_braveness\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"confront_enemy_angrily\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"charge_against_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_in_love\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kiss\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"feel_ambivalent_thoughts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_dead\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_jugular\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_own_throat\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.\n\nI notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.\n\nI'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax. For actions without subjects or objects, I'll represent them with just the action name. Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.\n\nI should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all.

infer the preconditions related to tensions. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA. If there are no required `tensions`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `tension` is an object with keys `type`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the `tension` as defined previously.\n\tB. `from` contains either values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘-’, ‘’ to indicate the character that is the source of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\tC. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the recipient of the tension. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action, ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action, ‘-’ refers to no character, and ‘*’ refers to any character\n\t\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to tensions. Tensions can be of several types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`.\n\nI'll start by understanding what each tension means:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character's life is in danger.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is compromised.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is being held captive.\n5. **clashing_emotions**: Conflicting emotions within a character towards another.\n6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action and determine if any tensions are preconditions for that action.\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event, no direct tension related to characters.\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Done because Jaguar_Knight's health is at risk.\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Same as above.\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Implies life_at_risk.\n6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.\n7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces prisoner tension.\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Driven by the need to save Princess, indicating her life is at risk.\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Confrontation increases life_at_risk.\n10. **charge_against_princess**: Direct threat to her life.\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Motivated by Princess being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to liberate, so Princess is still a prisoner.\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue, Princess still a prisoner.\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Same as above.\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct tension related to characters.\n16. **liberate_princess**: Ends the prisoner tension.\n17. **fall_in_love**: No tension here, just emotional link.\n18. **kiss**: Same as above.\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing emotions in Princess.\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions.\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Part of the tension leading to death.\n22. **cut_jugular**: Results in character dead.\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Also results in character dead.\n\nFor each action, I'll assign the relevant tensions as preconditions. If an action doesn't involve a tension, the array will be empty.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with preconditions related to tensions:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\":

Okay, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that occur after an action is performed. They can either create or modify emotional links between characters or alter existing tensions.

I'll start by understanding what each postcondition entails:

1. **Emotional Links**: These can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.
2. **Tensions**: These include `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. Additionally, there are normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` that resolve existing tensions.

For each action, I'll determine the resulting emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), it should be reflected in the postconditions as a normal tension. Also, if an action causes a new tension or changes an emotional link, it will be noted accordingly.

I'll process each action one by one:

1. **storm_caused_by_god**: Environmental event, no characters involved—no postconditions.
2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.
3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess helps Jaguar_Knight, likely creating a positive friendship link and resolving his health risk.
4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to above, reinforces the positive emotional link and resolves health issues.
5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Strengthens friendship bond due to gratitude.
6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.
7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces her captivity.
8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight's determination might increase his positive feelings towards Princess.
9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Increases negative emotions between Princess and Enemy.
10. **charge_against_princess**: Escalates the life_at_risk tension for Princess.
11. **search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, but doesn't create new ones yet.
12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to free Princess, resolving prisoner tension.
13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue process, leading towards freeing her.
14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Final action in freeing Princess, resolving prisoner tension.
15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct impact on tensions or emotional links.
16. **liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner tension completely.
17. **fall_in_love**: Establishes a romantic link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.
18. **kiss**: Reinforces the romantic link.
19. **recognize_tattoo**: Creates clashing emotions in Princess due to mixed feelings.
20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions tension.
21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Leads to Jaguar_Knight's death, creating character_dead tension.
22. **cut_jugular**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's death and Princess's grief.
23. **cut_own_throat**: Princess's action leads to her own death.

For each action, I'll assign the appropriate postconditions, ensuring that if preconditions exist, the postconditions are different. If an action resolves a tension (e.g., freeing a prisoner), it will include the normal tension in postconditions.

time=2025-04-02T13:07:39.630-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story step by step as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross it and gets injured. That's definitely a health_at_risk situation since he's badly hurt.\n\nPrincess finds out about his condition and knows he could die. She uses a curative plant to heal him. This action shows her determination, so this is an emotional link of friendship because she's saving his life in a platonic way.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizes she saved him, which strengthens their bond. So that's another friendship emotional link as gratitude builds their relationship.\n\nNext, there's a revenge plot where the enemy kidnaps Princess and ties her up. This creates prisoner tension for her. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing life_at_risk tension for both of them.\n\nPrincess is angry at the enemy, leading to clashing emotions because earlier she was scared but now she's confronting him. The enemy attacks her, which adds to the tension, specifically life_at_risk since she's about to be killed.\n\nJaguar prays for wisdom and bravery, showing his internal preparation but not directly an emotional link yet. He finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation where he attacks and kills the enemy. This frees Princess, so another prisoner tension resolution.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess feels admiration for Jaguar_Knight, developing romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear love emotional link.\n\nBut then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves him but hates what he did. She kills him and herself, leading to both characters_dead tension.\n\nEach action needs to be in JSON with subject, object, and number of characters. I'll list them chronologically as they appear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"bridge_collapse_injure_head\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"realize_determination_save_life\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kidnap_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"tie_to_rock\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"pray_for_wisdom_braveness\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"confront_enemy_angrily\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"charge_against_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_in_love\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kiss\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"feel_ambivalent_thoughts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_dead\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_jugular\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_own_throat\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object.

If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the specified DPS format. First, I'll recall the structure of the DPS example given. It starts with 'Sto' followed by a number, then lists actors and actions.\n\nLooking at the JSON, each action is between characters or involves one character. I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.\n\nI notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.\n\nI'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax.

Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.\n\nI should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all.

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze each action from the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event caused by a god, so no characters are involved. No emotional links here.\n\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: An accident happens, injuring Jaguar_Knight. No emotional link preconditions needed for this to occur.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess acts to save Jaguar_Knight. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight, magnitude 3 (strong affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to the previous action, reinforcing the positive friendship link.\n\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Jaguar_Knight feels gratitude towards Princess, indicating a positive friendship link.\n\n6. **kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess out of revenge, suggesting hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Enemy to Princess).\n\n7. **tie_to_rock**: The Enemy's action is driven by the same hatred.\n\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight seeks help, indicating his determination and positive feelings towards Princess.\n\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Princess confronts the Enemy angrily, showing hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Princess to Enemy).\n\n10. **charge_against_princess**: The Enemy's action is motivated by anger, reinforcing their negative emotional link.\n\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's determination to save Princess shows strong positive feelings towards her.\n\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Anger drives Jaguar_Knight to attack the Enemy (friendship magnitude -3).\n\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the combat, same as above.\n\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Continuation of the attack, driven by anger.\n\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: Jaguar_Knight's respect for gods, no direct emotional link to another character.\n\n16. **liberate_princess**: Driven by positive feelings towards Princess (friendship magnitude 3).\n\n17. **fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for Jaguar_Knight (love magnitude 3).\n\n18. **kiss**: Affectionate action based on love.\n\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to ambivalence in Princess, creating clashing emotions but not a direct precondition yet.\n\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Princess has conflicting feelings, affecting her emotional state.\n\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Emotional turmoil leads to hatred towards Jaguar_Knight (friendship magnitude -3).\n\n22. **cut_jugular**: Driven by intense negative emotions (hatred).\n\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Result of internal conflict and grief, no direct emotional link precondition needed.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition is correctly assigned with type, magnitude, and direction ('from' and 'to').

Tensions can be of several types: `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`.\n\nI'll start by understanding what each tension means:\n\n1. **character_dead**: A character has died.\n2. **life_at_risk**: A character's life is in danger.\n3. **health_at_risk**: A character's health is compromised.\n4. **prisoner**: A character is being held captive.\n5. **clashing_emotions**: Conflicting emotions within a character towards another.\n6. **love_competition**: Two characters have romantic feelings for the same third character.\n\nNow, I'll go through each action and determine if any tensions are preconditions for that action.\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event, no direct tension related to characters.\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Done because Jaguar_Knight's health is at risk.\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Same as above.\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Implies life_at_risk.\n6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.\n7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces prisoner tension.\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Driven by the need to save Princess, indicating her life is at risk.\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Confrontation increases life_at_risk.\n10. **charge_against_princess**: Direct threat to her life.\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Motivated by Princess being a prisoner and her life at risk.\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to liberate, so Princess is still a prisoner.\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue, Princess still a prisoner.\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Same as above.\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct tension related to characters.\n16. **liberate_princess**: Ends the prisoner tension.\n17. **fall_in_love**: No tension here, just emotional link.\n18. **kiss**: Same as above.\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to clashing emotions in Princess.\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions.\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Part of the tension leading to death.\n22. **cut_jugular**: Results in character dead.\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Also results in character dead.\n\nFor each action, I'll assign the relevant tensions as preconditions.

A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that occur after an action is performed. They can either create or modify emotional links between characters or alter existing tensions.\n\nI'll start by understanding what each postcondition entails:\n\n1. **Emotional Links**: These can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n2. **Tensions**: These include `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. Additionally, there are normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` that resolve existing tensions.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine the resulting emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), it should be reflected in the postconditions as a normal tension. Also, if an action causes a new tension or changes an emotional link, it will be noted accordingly.\n\nI'll process each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: Environmental event, no characters involved—no postconditions.\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess helps Jaguar_Knight, likely creating a positive friendship link and resolving his health risk.\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to above, reinforces the positive emotional link and resolves health issues.\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Strengthens friendship bond due to gratitude.\n6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.\n7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces her captivity.\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight's determination might increase his positive feelings towards Princess.\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Increases negative emotions between Princess and Enemy.\n10. **charge_against_princess**: Escalates the life_at_risk tension for Princess.\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, but doesn't create new ones yet.\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to free Princess, resolving prisoner tension.\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue process, leading towards freeing her.\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Final action in freeing Princess, resolving prisoner tension.\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct impact on tensions or emotional links.\n16. **liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner tension completely.\n17. **fall_in_love**: Establishes a romantic link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n18. **kiss**: Reinforces the romantic link.\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Creates clashing emotions in Princess due to mixed feelings.\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions tension.\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Leads to Jaguar_Knight's death, creating character_dead tension.\n22. **cut_jugular**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's death and Princess's grief.\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Princess's action leads to her own death.\n\nFor each action, I'll assign the appropriate postconditions, ensuring that if preconditions exist, the postconditions are different. If an action resolves a tension (e.g., freeing a prisoner), it will include the normal tension in postconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with postconditions for each

<think>
Alright, I need to ensure logical consistency across all actions in the JSON object by verifying that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. Additionally, I must guarantee that:

1. **Character IDs**: Only 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object) are used. If an action has only one character ('n_characters': 1), then only 'a' should be referenced.
2. **Death Consistency**: Once a character dies (`character_dead` tension), they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions.
3. **Preconditions vs Postconditions**: Ensure that postconditions are not the same as preconditions, representing a change in state.
4. **Emotional Links**: No duplicates between preconditions and postconditions for emotional links.

I'll go through each action to check these points:

1. **storm_caused_by_god**:
   - `n_characters`: 1
   - Only 'a' should be used, but since it's an environmental event with no characters, this is fine.
   
2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**:
   - `n_characters`: 1 (Jaguar_Knight)
   - Preconditions: No emotional links; one tension (`health_at_risk`).
   - Postconditions: One tension (`health_at_risk`). This needs to be a change, but since it's the same, I'll adjust postconditions to reflect a new state or remove if necessary.

3. **prepare_curative_plasma**:
   - `n_characters`: 2 (Princess and Jaguar_Knight)
   - Preconditions: Princess has a positive friendship link towards Jaguar_Knight.
   - Postconditions: Positive friendship from Jaguar_Knight to Princess, resolving health tension. This is consistent as it's a change.

4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**:
   - Similar to above; no issues.

5. **realize_determination_save_life**:
   - `n_characters`: 1 (Jaguar_Knight)
   - Postconditions: Positive friendship towards Princess, but since 'b' isn't defined, this might need adjustment.

6. **kidnap_princess** and **tie_to_rock**:
   - Both have `n_characters`: 2.
   - Consistent use of 'a' (Enemy) and 'b' (Princess).

7. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**:
   - `n_characters`: 1, so only 'a' should be used. Current postconditions reference 'b', which is invalid.

8. **confront_enemy_angrily**, **charge_against_princess**:
   - Both have consistent use of 'a' and 'b'.

9. **search_for_enemy**:
   - `n_characters`: 1, but postconditions don't reference any characters, so this is fine.

10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**:
    - Consistent use of 'a' and 'b'.

11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**:
    - No characters involved; no issues.

12. **liberate_princess**:
    - Postconditions correctly reference both 'a' and 'b', resolving tensions.

13. **fall_in_love**, **kiss**:
    - Both have consistent use of emotional links without duplication.

14. **recognize_tattoo**, **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**:
    - Use of 'a' only, which is correct for `n_characters`: 1.

15. **invoke_god_of_dead**, **cut_jugular**, **cut_own_throat**:
    - Consistent use of 'a' and proper tension handling after death.

After this analysis, I'll adjust any inconsistencies, especially where 'b' is referenced when `n_characters` is 1 or where postconditions mirror preconditions without a state change.

time=2025-04-02T13:09:37.875-06:00 level=DEBUG source=routes.go:1501 msg="chat request" images=0 prompt="<｜User｜>You are a narrative analysis expert that systematically identifies and interprets actions, preconditions, and effects (called postconditions) within stories, contributing to a structured understanding of a narrative. You are primarily focused on actions that relate to the emotional relationships between characters (called emotional links) and actions that build tension within the narrative (called tensions).\n\nYou are focused on specific types of emotional links. By default, consider two types of emotional links: `friendship` and `love`. `friendship` refers to how much one character likes another character in a platonic sense. `love` refers to romantic love. \n\nYou are also focused on specific types of tensions. By default, consider the following tension types:\n\n1. `character_dead`\n2. `life_at_risk`\n3. `health_at_risk`\n4. `prisoner`\n5. `clashing_emotions`\n6. `love_competition`\n\n`character_dead` means a character has died. `life_at_risk` means a character’s life is at risk. `health_at_risk` means a character's health is at risk. `prisoner` means a character is in prison or detained in some way. `clashing_emotions` is produced when a character establishes two or more emotional Links of any type but opposite intensity towards another character. For example, if a princess initially hates an enemy (negative emotional link) but later develops feelings of love or gratitude towards the same enemy (positive emotional link), this would create `clashing_emotions`. A tension of `love_competion` arises when two different characters have an emotional link of type `love` towards the same third character.\n\nAnalyze the given story and extract the essential actions from the main characters. Focus on actions that relate to the emotional links between characters and the tensions in the narrative. \n\nOrganize the actions in chronological order and in JSON format . The JSON should have an `action` key for each action. The value for each action should be as simple and general as possible so that it can be reused in other stories, avoid character names, and be in Snake_case. Each `action` should have a key for the number of characters involved in the action called `n_characters`, a key called `subject` for the character performing the action, and a key called `object` for the character receiving the action. If the action lacks a `subject` or `object` store a value of `-` in the key. For now, only include these specified keys in the JSON object. Make sure that `n_characters` is consistent with the presence of the `subject` and `object` characters. The same character may be both the `subject` and the `object` character if the character is performing an action on themself.\n\nHere is the story:\nJAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. PRINCESS WAS AN INHABITANT OF THE GREAT TENOCHTITLAN. TLALOC —THE GOD OF THE RAIN— WAS ANGRY AND SENT A STORM. THE HEAVY RAIN DAMAGED THE OLD WOODEN BRIDGE. WHEN JAGUAR_KNIGHT TRIED TO CROSS THE RIVER THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED INJURING BADLY JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S HEAD. PRINCESS KNEW THAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD DIE AND THAT PRINCESS HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRINCESS HAD HEARD THAT THE TEPESCOHUITLE WAS AN EFFECTIVE CURATIVE PLANT. SO, PRINCESS PREPARED A PLASMA AND APPLIED IT TO JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S WOUNDS. IT WORKED AND JAGUAR_KNIGHT STARTED TO RECUPERATE! JAGUAR_KNIGHT REALISED THAT PRINCESS'S DETERMINATION HAD SAVED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S LIFE. DURING THE LAST WAR PRINCESS'S FATHER HUMILIATED ENEMY'S FAMILY. NOW, IT WAS TIME OF REVENGE AND ENEMY KIDNAPPED PRINCESS. THEY WENT TO THE FOREST WHERE ENEMY TIED PRINCESS TO A HUGE ROCK. EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT ENEMY WOULD CUT PRINCESS UP. ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE PRINCESS. FOR SOME MINUTES JAGUAR_KNIGHT PRAYED TO QUETZALCOATL —THE FEATHERED SNAKE, THE GOD BETWEEN THE GODS— AND ASKED FOR WISDOM AND BRAVENESS. NOW JAGUAR_KNIGHT WAS READY TO FIND OUT ITS FATE. PRINCESS WAS REALLY ANGRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFFRONTED ENEMY. ENEMY'S FRAME OF MIND WAS VERY VOLATILE AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT ENEMY CHARGED AGAINST PRINCESS. MEANWHILE JAGUAR_KNIGHT DECIDED TO START A SEARCH FOR ENEMY. AFTER HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT COULD FINALLY FIND ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT, FULL OF ANGER, TOOK A DAGGER AND ATTACKED ENEMY. JAGUAR_KNIGHT THREW SOME DUST IN ENEMY'S FACE. THEN, USING A DAGGER JAGUAR_KNIGHT PERFORATED ENEMY'S CHEST. IMITATING THE SACRED CEREMONY OF THE SACRIFICE, JAGUAR_KNIGHT TOOK ENEMY'S HEART WITH ONE HAND AND RAISED IT TOWARDS THE SUN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT TO THE GODS. JAGUAR_KNIGHT WALKED TOWARDS PRINCESS. FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE BRAVENESS THAT PRINCESS HAD SHOWN IN THOSE HARD MOMENTS JAGUAR_KNIGHT LIBERATED PRINCESS! ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT, PRINCESS FELL IN LOVE WITH JAGUAR_KNIGHT. PRINCESS WAS KISSING JAGUAR_KNIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY PRINCESS RECOGNISED JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S TATTOO. IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE USED BY THE FRATERNITY WHICH HAD MURDERED PRINCESS'S FATHER SOME MONTHS AGO. AT ONCE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE MEMORIES WERE PRESENT AGAIN. PRINCESS HAD AMBIVALENT THOUGHTS TOWARDS JAGUAR_KNIGHT. ON THE ONE HAND PRINCESS HAD STRONG FEELINGS FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCESS ABOMINATED WHAT JAGUAR_KNIGHT DID. PRINCESS FELT A DEEPLY ODIUM FOR JAGUAR_KNIGHT. INVOKING HUITZILOPOCHTLI, GOD OF THE DEAD, PRINCESS CUT JAGUAR_KNIGHT'S JUGULAR. THE BLOOD COVERED THE FLOOR. PRINCESS TOOK A DAGGER AND CUT PRINCESS’S THROAT. PRINCESS BLED TO DEATH WHILE TONATIU (THE GOD REPRESENTING THE SUN) DISAPPEARED IN THE HORIZON.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this story step by step as a narrative analysis expert focusing on emotional links and tensions.\n\nFirst, the storm caused by Tlaloc damages the bridge. Jaguar_Knight tries to cross it and gets injured. That's definitely a health_at_risk situation since he's badly hurt.\n\nPrincess finds out about his condition and knows he could die. She uses a curative plant to heal him. This action shows her determination, so this is an emotional link of friendship because she's saving his life in a platonic way.\n\nJaguar_Knight realizes she saved him, which strengthens their bond. So that's another friendship emotional link as gratitude builds their relationship.\n\nNext, there's a revenge plot where the enemy kidnaps Princess and ties her up. This creates prisoner tension for her. Jaguar decides to rescue her despite the danger, showing life_at_risk tension for both of them.\n\nPrincess is angry at the enemy, leading to clashing emotions because earlier she was scared but now she's confronting him. The enemy attacks her, which adds to the tension, specifically life_at_risk since she's about to be killed.\n\nJaguar prays for wisdom and bravery, showing his internal preparation but not directly an emotional link yet. He finds the enemy, leading to a confrontation where he attacks and kills the enemy. This frees Princess, so another prisoner tension resolution.\n\nAfter being rescued, Princess feels admiration for Jaguar_Knight, developing romantic feelings. They kiss, which is a clear love emotional link.\n\nBut then she recognizes his tattoo linked to her father's murder. This creates clashing emotions: she loves him but hates what he did. She kills him and herself, leading to both characters_dead tension.\n\nEach action needs to be in JSON with subject, object, and number of characters. I'll list them chronologically as they appear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"storm_caused_by_god\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"bridge_collapse_injure_head\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"prepare_curative_plasma\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"apply_plasma_to_wounds\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"realize_determination_save_life\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kidnap_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"tie_to_rock\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"pray_for_wisdom_braveness\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"confront_enemy_angrily\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"charge_against_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"enemy\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"search_for_enemy\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"attack_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"throw_dust_in_face\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"perforate_chest_with_dagger\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"enemy\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"imitate_sacred_ceremony\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"liberate_princess\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"jaguar_knight\",\n        \"object\": \"princess\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"fall_in_love\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"kiss\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"recognize_tattoo\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"feel_ambivalent_thoughts\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"invoke_god_of_dead\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_jugular\",\n        \"n_characters\": 2,\n        \"subject\": \"princess\",\n        \"object\": \"jaguar_knight\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"cut_own_throat\",\n        \"n_characters\": 1,\n        \"subject\": \"-\",\n        \"object\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Convert the JSON object to a structure called Definition of Previous Stories (DPS). \n\nHere is a formal description:\n\n```\nStory = ‘STO’, <Sequence of Actions>.\nSequence of Actions = <Action>, {<Sequence of Actions>}.\nAction = <String Subject Character (optional)> <String Action> <String Object Character (optional)>.\nString Character = <String>.\nString Action = <String>.\nString = Any character represented in ASCIII.\n; = Begin inline comment.\n```\nHere is an example:\n```\nSto ;1\nEagle_Knight Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEagle_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nJaguar_Knight Was_In_Love_With Princess\nPrincess Was_In_Love_With Warrior\nEagle_Knight Got_Jealous_Of Warrior\nEagle_Knight Killed Warrior\nPrincess Attacked Eagle_Knight\nEagle_Knight Wounded Princess\nJaguar_Knight Attacked Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Fought Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Killed Eagle_Knight\nJaguar_Knight Exiled Jaguar_Knight\n```\n\nEnsure that the action and character name strings used in the DPS syntax match the strings used in the JSON object. An action is not required to have a `subject` or an `object` character. If a `subject` or an `object` are missing from the JSON object simply do not add it to the action line.\nReturn your result between <DPS></DPS> tags.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to convert the provided JSON into the specified DPS format. First, I'll recall the structure of the DPS example given. It starts with 'Sto' followed by a number, then lists actors and actions.\n\nLooking at the JSON, each action is between characters or involves one character. I'll extract each action line by line, ensuring that if there's no subject or object, they are omitted in DPS.\n\nI notice that some actions involve two characters, like 'prepare_curative_plasma' with Princess as subject and Jaguar_Knight as object. Others only have a subject, like 'pray_for_wisdom_braveness', where the subject is implied but there's no object.\n\nI'll list each action in order, translating the JSON keys into DPS syntax. For actions without subjects or objects, I'll represent them with just the action name. Also, I need to ensure that character names match exactly as in the JSON.\n\nI should also handle the special case where a character is both subject and object, but in this JSON, it seems each action has distinct characters or none at all. Finally, I'll compile all these into the DPS structure under the <DPS> tags.\n</think>\n\nHere is the converted JSON object to the Definition of Previous Stories (DPS) format:\n\n```plaintext\n<DPS>\nSto ;1\nPrincess Actor\nJaguar_Knight Actor\nEnemy Actor\nTlaloc Actor\nQuetzalcoatl Actor\nHuitzilopochtli Actor\nTonatiu Actor\n\nstorm_caused_by_god Tlaloc storm_caused_by_god -\nbridge_collapse_injure_head - bridge_collapse_injure_head jaguar_knight\nprepare_curative_plasma princess prepare_curative_plasma jaguar_knight\napply_plasma_to_wounds princess apply_plasma_to_wounds jaguar_knight\nrealize_determination_save_life - realize_determination_save_life -\nkidnap_princess enemy kidnep_princess princess\ntie_to_rock enemy tie_to_rock princess\npray_for_wisdom_braveness jaguar_knight pray_for_wisdom_braveness quetzalcoatl\nconfront_enemy_angrily princess confront_enemy_angrily enemy\ncharge_against_princess enemy charge_against_princess princess\nsearch_for_enemy jaguar_knight search_for_enemy -\nattack_with_dagger jaguar_knight attack_with_dagger enemy\nthrow_dust_in_face jaguar_knight throw_dust_in_face enemy\nperforate_chest_with_dagger jaguar_knight perforate_chest_with_dagger enemy\nimitate_sacred_ceremony jaguar_knight imitate_sacred_ceremony -\nliberate_princess jaguar_knight liberate_princess princess\nfall_in_love princess fall_in_love -\nkiss princess kiss jaguar_knight\nrecognize_tattoo princess recognize_tattoo -\nfeel_ambivalent_thoughts princess feel_ambivalent_thoughts -\ninvoke_god_of_dead princess invoke_god_of_dead huitzilopochtli\ncut_jugular princess cut_jugular jaguar_knight\ncut_own_throat princess cut_own_throat -\n</DPS>\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. An emotional link that is a precondition is an emotional link that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\n\nEach emotional link has a magnitude of an integer value in the range [-3, 3]. In order to take a particular action and satisfy the precondition, a character might need to have a specific type and magnitude of emotional link towards another character before performing an action.\n\nFor example, if character `a` attacks character `b`, and the precondition requires an emotional link type of `friendship` and a magnitude of -3 (indicating hatred) from character `a` to character `b`, then character `a` must have an emotional link of type `friendship` of magnitude -3 toward character `b` in order to `attack`. \n\nPreconditions are optional.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to emotional links by following the instructions below. \n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `preconditions`.\n2. In the `preconditions` key create an object with a key called `emotional_links`\n3. Assign an array to the `emotional_links` key containing the identified or inferred emotional links.\n\tA. If there are no required `emotional_links`, leave the array empty\n4. Each `emotional_link` is an object with keys `type`, `magnitude`, `from`, and `to`\n\tA. `type` contains the type of the emotional link as defined previously.\n\tB. `magnitude` contains the intensity of the emotional link in the range [-3, 3]\n\tC. `from` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the source of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\tD. `to` contains either values ‘a’ or ‘b’ to indicate the character that is the target of the emotional link. ‘a’ refers to the `subject` performing the action and ‘b’ refers to the `object` receiving the action\n\nReturn this new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to analyze each action from the provided JSON and identify or infer the preconditions related to emotional links. Emotional links can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n\nI'll go through each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: This is an environmental event caused by a god, so no characters are involved. No emotional links here.\n\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: An accident happens, injuring Jaguar_Knight. No emotional link preconditions needed for this to occur.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess acts to save Jaguar_Knight. This implies a positive friendship link from Princess to Jaguar_Knight, magnitude 3 (strong affection).\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to the previous action, reinforcing the positive friendship link.\n\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Jaguar_Knight feels gratitude towards Princess, indicating a positive friendship link.\n\n6. **kidnap_princess**: The enemy kidnaps Princess out of revenge, suggesting hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Enemy to Princess).\n\n7. **tie_to_rock**: The Enemy's action is driven by the same hatred.\n\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight seeks help, indicating his determination and positive feelings towards Princess.\n\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Princess confronts the Enemy angrily, showing hatred (friendship magnitude -3 from Princess to Enemy).\n\n10. **charge_against_princess**: The Enemy's action is motivated by anger, reinforcing their negative emotional link.\n\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Jaguar_Knight's determination to save Princess shows strong positive feelings towards her.\n\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Anger drives Jaguar_Knight to attack the Enemy (friendship magnitude -3).\n\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the combat, same as above.\n\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Continuation of the attack, driven by anger.\n\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: Jaguar_Knight's respect for gods, no direct emotional link to another character.\n\n16. **liberate_princess**: Driven by positive feelings towards Princess (friendship magnitude 3).\n\n17. **fall_in_love**: Princess develops romantic feelings for Jaguar_Knight (love magnitude 3).\n\n18. **kiss**: Affectionate action based on love.\n\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Leads to ambivalence in Princess, creating clashing emotions but not a direct precondition yet.\n\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Princess has conflicting feelings, affecting her emotional state.\n\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Emotional turmoil leads to hatred towards Jaguar_Knight (friendship magnitude -3).\n\n22. **cut_jugular**: Driven by intense negative emotions (hatred).\n\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Result of internal conflict and grief, no direct emotional link precondition needed.\n\nI need to ensure each precondition is correctly assigned with type, magnitude, and direction ('from' and 'to').

A precondition is a requirement that needs to be satisfied in order for a character to perform a specific action. These requirements take the form of either an emotional link or a tension. A tension that is a precondition is a tension that should exist in order for taking the action to make sense.\n\nIdentify or infer the preconditions that relate to tensions by following the instructions below.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. In the `preconditions` object create a key called `tensions`\n2. Assign an array to the `tensions` key containing the identified or inferred tensions.\n\tA.

}\n]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>For each action, identify or infer the postconditions. A postcondition is a change to an emotional link or tension caused by the action. While preconditions are optional, at least one postcondition is required for each action. If preconditions exist, the postconditions must not be the same as the preconditions.\n\nThere is a special type of postcondition called normal tensions which resolve certain tensions in the preconditions. These normal tensions include: `life_normal`, `health_normal` and `prisoner_freed`. `life_normal` resolves the tension `life_at_risk`, `health_normal` resolves the tension `health_at_risk`, and `prisoner_freed` resolves the tension `prisoner`.\n\nInstructions for each action:\n1. Create a new key called `postconditions`\n2. Assign an object to the `postconditions` key containing the keys `emotional_links` and `tensions`\n3. Assign an array of emotional links to the `emotional_links` key. Add emotional links that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action. In general, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a positive effect, let the `object` character develop a positive emotional link toward the `subject` character. However, if a `subject` character performs an action on an `object` character that has a negative effect, let the `object` character develop a negative emotional link toward the `subject` character.\n4. Assign an array of tensions to the `tensions` key. Add tensions that can be identified or inferred as a result of the action.\n\nReturn the new JSON object.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, I need to go through each action in the provided JSON and identify or infer the postconditions related to emotional links and tensions. Postconditions are changes that occur after an action is performed. They can either create or modify emotional links between characters or alter existing tensions.\n\nI'll start by understanding what each postcondition entails:\n\n1. **Emotional Links**: These can be of type 'friendship' or 'love', with magnitudes ranging from -3 to 3.\n2. **Tensions**: These include `character_dead`, `life_at_risk`, `health_at_risk`, `prisoner`, `clashing_emotions`, and `love_competition`. Additionally, there are normal tensions like `life_normal`, `health_normal`, and `prisoner_freed` that resolve existing tensions.\n\nFor each action, I'll determine the resulting emotional links and tensions. If an action resolves a tension (like freeing a prisoner), it should be reflected in the postconditions as a normal tension. Also, if an action causes a new tension or changes an emotional link, it will be noted accordingly.\n\nI'll process each action one by one:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**: Environmental event, no characters involved—no postconditions.\n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**: Causes health risk for Jaguar_Knight.\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**: Princess helps Jaguar_Knight, likely creating a positive friendship link and resolving his health risk.\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**: Similar to above, reinforces the positive emotional link and resolves health issues.\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**: Strengthens friendship bond due to gratitude.\n6. **kidnap_princess**: Creates prisoner tension for Princess.\n7. **tie_to_rock**: Reinforces her captivity.\n8. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**: Jaguar_Knight's determination might increase his positive feelings towards Princess.\n9. **confront_enemy_angrily**: Increases negative emotions between Princess and Enemy.\n10. **charge_against_princess**: Escalates the life_at_risk tension for Princess.\n11. **search_for_enemy**: Driven by existing tensions, but doesn't create new ones yet.\n12. **attack_with_dagger**: Aims to free Princess, resolving prisoner tension.\n13. **throw_dust_in_face**: Part of the rescue process, leading towards freeing her.\n14. **perforate_chest_with_dagger**: Final action in freeing Princess, resolving prisoner tension.\n15. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**: No direct impact on tensions or emotional links.\n16. **liberate_princess**: Resolves prisoner tension completely.\n17. **fall_in_love**: Establishes a romantic link between Princess and Jaguar_Knight.\n18. **kiss**: Reinforces the romantic link.\n19. **recognize_tattoo**: Creates clashing emotions in Princess due to mixed feelings.\n20. **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**: Directly relates to clashing_emotions tension.\n21. **invoke_god_of_dead**: Leads to Jaguar_Knight's death, creating character_dead tension.\n22. **cut_jugular**: Results in Jaguar_Knight's death and Princess's grief.\n23. **cut_own_throat**: Princess's action leads to her own death.\n\nFor each action, I'll assign the appropriate postconditions, ensuring that if preconditions exist, the postconditions are different. If an action resolves a tension (e.g., freeing a prisoner), it will include the normal tension in postconditions.\n</think>\n\nHere is the JSON object with postconditions for each

for each action. Make sure `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in the preconditions and postconditions. If `n_characters` is 1, only the id `a` should be used in the emotional links and tensions. If a character dies, it is illogical for the dead character to experience any other kind of emotional connections or tensions. Preconditions and postconditions should not be the same because postconditions represent a change in state for the characters. An emotional link in the postconditions cannot be the same as the emotional link in the preconditions. Ensure that `a` and `b` are the only values being used for emotional links, tensions, and normal tensions (`health_normal`, `life_normal`, and `prisoner_freed`). Make sure `a` is referring to the subject character and `b` is referring to the object character. The same character id (`a` or `b`) can be used for both the `from` and `to` keys if that character is performing an action on themself. Avoid any other kind of illogical situations. \n<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, I need to ensure logical consistency across all actions in the JSON object by verifying that each action's `n_characters` matches the number of characters referenced in preconditions and postconditions. Additionally, I must guarantee that:\n\n1. **Character IDs**: Only 'a' (subject) and 'b' (object) are used. If an action has only one character ('n_characters': 1), then only 'a' should be referenced.\n2. **Death Consistency**: Once a character dies (`character_dead` tension), they shouldn't have any further emotional links or tensions.\n3. **Preconditions vs Postconditions**: Ensure that postconditions are not the same as preconditions, representing a change in state.\n4. **Emotional Links**: No duplicates between preconditions and postconditions for emotional links.\n\nI'll go through each action to check these points:\n\n1. **storm_caused_by_god**:\n   - `n_characters`: 1\n   - Only 'a' should be used, but since it's an environmental event with no characters, this is fine.\n   \n2. **bridge_collapse_injure_head**:\n   - `n_characters`: 1 (Jaguar_Knight)\n   - Preconditions: No emotional links; one tension (`health_at_risk`).\n   - Postconditions: One tension (`health_at_risk`). This needs to be a change, but since it's the same, I'll adjust postconditions to reflect a new state or remove if necessary.\n\n3. **prepare_curative_plasma**:\n   - `n_characters`: 2 (Princess and Jaguar_Knight)\n   - Preconditions: Princess has a positive friendship link towards Jaguar_Knight.\n   - Postconditions: Positive friendship from Jaguar_Knight to Princess, resolving health tension. This is consistent as it's a change.\n\n4. **apply_plasma_to_wounds**:\n   - Similar to above; no issues.\n\n5. **realize_determination_save_life**:\n   - `n_characters`: 1 (Jaguar_Knight)\n   - Postconditions: Positive friendship towards Princess, but since 'b' isn't defined, this might need adjustment.\n\n6. **kidnap_princess** and **tie_to_rock**:\n   - Both have `n_characters`: 2.\n   - Consistent use of 'a' (Enemy) and 'b' (Princess).\n\n7. **pray_for_wisdom_braveness**:\n   - `n_characters`: 1, so only 'a' should be used. Current postconditions reference 'b', which is invalid.\n\n8. **confront_enemy_angrily**, **charge_against_princess**:\n   - Both have consistent use of 'a' and 'b'.\n\n9. **search_for_enemy**:\n   - `n_characters`: 1, but postconditions don't reference any characters, so this is fine.\n\n10. **attack_with_dagger**, **throw_dust_in_face**, **perforate_chest_with_dagger**:\n    - Consistent use of 'a' and 'b'.\n\n11. **imitate_sacred_ceremony**:\n    - No characters involved; no issues.\n\n12. **liberate_princess**:\n    - Postconditions correctly reference both 'a' and 'b', resolving tensions.\n\n13. **fall_in_love**, **kiss**:\n    - Both have consistent use of emotional links without duplication.\n\n14. **recognize_tattoo**, **feel_ambivalent_thoughts**:\n    - Use of 'a' only, which is correct for `n_characters`: 1.\n\n15. **invoke_god_of_dead**, **cut_jugular**, **cut_own_throat**:\n    - Consistent use of 'a' and proper tension handling after death.\n\nAfter this analysis, I'll adjust any inconsistencies, especially where 'b' is referenced when `n_characters` is 1 or where postconditions mirror preconditions without a state change.\n</think>\n\nHere is the

<think>
Okay, so I need to convert this complex JSON object into a PAD language structure. PAD stands for Primitive Action Description, right? From what I understand, it's a story-grammar style that describes actions with their preconditions and postconditions using a specific syntax.

First, I'll look at the example provided:

```
ACT
Attacked 2
PRE
E a b -2 *
POS
E b a -3 1
T Lr b a 
```

And another one:

```
ACT
Cured 2
PRE
T Hr b *
POS
E b a +3 1
T Hn b a
```

From this, I can see that each action starts with 'ACT', followed by the action name and the number of characters involved. Then there's an optional 'PRE' section for preconditions, which include emotional links (starting with E) and tensions (starting with T). After that, the 'POS' section describes postconditions, again including emotional links and tensions.

Emotional links are formatted as `E <from> <to> <magnitude> (<type>)`, where type is 1 for friendship and 2 for love. Tensions are `T <tension_type> <to> [<from>]`. The tension types are abbreviated like 'Lr' for life_at_risk, 'Hr' for health_at_risk, etc.

So, my goal is to take each action from the JSON and convert it into this PAD format. I'll need to:

1. Extract the action name and number of characters.
2. Identify any preconditions (emotional links and tensions).
3. Describe postconditions, ensuring they reflect changes in state.

I also notice that negative magnitudes are written with a minus sign (-) and positive ones with a plus (+). For example, -3 for hatred or +3 for strong love.

Let's start with the first action: "storm_caused_by_god". It has 1 character (but it's actually an environmental event without characters), no preconditions, and no postconditions. So, in PAD:

```
ACT
storm_caused_by_god 1
POS
```

Since there are no preconditions or postconditions, I'll just have the action line.

Next action: "bridge_collapse_injure_head". It involves Jaguar_Knight (1 character), with a precondition of health_at_risk and a postcondition of health_at_risk. Wait, but in PAD, the JSON had preconditions empty and postconditions adding 'health_at_risk'. So:

```
ACT
bridge_collapse_injure_head 1
POS
T Hr b *
```

But since 'b' refers to the object character, which is Jaguar_Knight, maybe it should be:

```
ACT
bridge_collapse_injure_head 1
POS
T Hr a *
```

Wait, in PAD, 'a' is the subject and 'b' is the object. Since there's only one character here, I think using 'a' makes sense.

Moving on to "prepare_curative_plasma" with 2 characters (Princess and Jaguar_Knight). Preconditions include Princess having a friendship of +3 towards Jaguar_Knight and health_at_risk tension. Postconditions have Jaguar_Knight developing a friendship of +3 towards Princess and resolving the health risk:

```
ACT
prepare_curative_plasma 2
PRE
E a b +3 1
T Hr b *
POS
E b a +3 1
T Hn b *
```

I'll follow this pattern for each action, carefully mapping emotional links and tensions from JSON to PAD syntax. I need to ensure that negative magnitudes are correctly prefixed with '-' and positive ones with '+'. Also, I must handle cases where there are no preconditions by omitting the 'PRE' section.

For actions involving death or prisoner states, I'll use the appropriate tension abbreviations like 'Ad' for character_dead and 'Pr' for prisoner. Normal tensions like health_normal ('Hn'), life_normal ('Ln'), and prisoner_freed ('Pf') will be used to resolve existing tensions in postconditions.

I also need to ensure that emotional links are correctly formatted, with the 'from' and 'to' characters specified as 'a', 'b', '*', or '-'. If a character performs an action on themselves, both 'from' and 'to' would be the same character ID.

By systematically converting each JSON object into PAD syntax, I'll ensure that all actions are accurately represented with their respective preconditions and postconditions.

Here is the JSON object converted into the Primitive Action Description (PAD) language:

This PAD structure accurately represents each action with its respective number of characters, preconditions, and postconditions. Emotional links are denoted with 'E', followed by the source ('a' or 'b'), target ('a', 'b', '*', or '-'), magnitude (with '+' for positive and '-' for negative), and type (1 for friendship, 2 for love). Tensions are represented with 'T', the tension type abbreviation, the affected character, and optionally the source character. Normal tensions like 'Hn' (health_normal) and 'Pf' (prisoner_freed) are used to resolve existing tensions in postconditions.
